These were published during the Victorian era, and there are entire journals of scholarly work from people researching and interpreting works from this time period. Each sister is known to have had their own writing style, some focusing more on poetry and some more on novels. All three grew up in a home with several siblings, but only the three of them lived past childhood, due to widespread illness, so death, loss, and domestic life (literally, life lived inside the home) are recurring themes for all three. To download these books, I am pulling them from Project Gutenburg, which makes books available in an ASCII format. Paragraphs are separated by a double newline character, and chapters are labeled with a \"CHAPTER I\" or similar heading. These ASCII files begin and end with long copyright statements that are not about the book itself. There is also a table of contents before the start of the text. So, before scraping these files, I will manually remove the copyright statements and the tables of content.\nI want to identify scenes where characters are drinking, making, or talking about tea. It is known that domestic life is an important theme in the Bronte novels, and that tea was an important ritual in domestical life across authors during that time period.\nMy code will identify as a \"tea scene\" any paragraph that contains the regex pattern \"\\Wtea\\W\", ignoring case. It will add the three paragraphs before and the three paragraphs after that central paragraph to the \"tea scene,\" so long as those paragraphs are in the same chapter. And any scenes that overlap this way will be combined. I will continue to revise this logic, adding other possible keywords, such as \"\\Wcup\\W\".

Our goal here is to minimize just how complex [the game] is. Not to make it not complex. It is impossible to make Magic not complex. It’s complex.And part of doing that is, you need some breathers. You need to concentrate your complexity where it matters. And the way I like to think about it is, imagine that you have points for your complexity. And you had a limit. You only get so many complexity points. Well, every time you make a common card you have to add, you have to say, “How many complexity points are on this card, and is it worth it? Do I need this to be?”And the reality is, I need some creatures. Common creatures. I mean, I’m not saying that all of them are vanilla or [simple] and such. You need to have a lot of simple stuff like that, only because you need to allow your brain to be able to focus.Because what happens is, if you give your brain too much, instead of being able to focus, it kind of just blurs things out. And what will happen is, when we do focus testing and watch people playing Magic, and even more experienced players, watching Magic, that if you get past the overload point, once your brain can’t handle it all, your brain just like dulls out and goes, “Okay…” and you kind of don’t think about things. And what we want to do is we want people to be able to spend the time and energy to think about things, so it’s a matter of focusing your complexity.And once again, a big part of design is saying, “There’s a cost that comes with making what I’m making, do I want to spend that cost?” And one of which is complexity. That’s a big one, which is, “This is complex. How complex?”And the way I think of it, I always use the term “complexity points,” and people think we have a system, where we have actual points. We don’t. It’s just easier to think of it this way, which is if I’m looking at a file, and I have three cards at common let’s say, that I know are all sort of causing a certain amount of mental strain on my player. I might have to say to myself, “Where do I want the mental strain?” It’s not that I don’t want to have some mentally taxing cards, but I want to be careful that the mentally taxing cards are what contribute to making it fun. ...","category":"page"},{"location":"journal14/","page":"Reading / Journal 14","title":"Reading / Journal 14","text":"Magic the Gathering has a lot of metaphors useful for Computer Science, and its rule system was in part inspired by theoretical computer science.","category":"page"},{"location":"journal14/","page":"Reading / Journal 14","title":"Reading / Journal 14","text":"The takeaway from this exerpt for us today is: Where do you want to invest your mental efforts?","category":"page"},{"location":"journal14/","page":"Reading / Journal 14","title":"Reading / Journal 14","text":"You could be making a large project, with several subcomponents, and several classes, and several methods.

What decisions can I make based on that result? If you're the only person I'd be giving the test to, wouldn't I be better off just interviewing and getting to know you myself? In other words, just like in the QE book, we have data, and we need to make proper sense of it.","category":"page"},{"location":"journal07/","page":"Reading / Journal 7","title":"Reading / Journal 7","text":"Now read Table C from the \"Code of Fair Testing Practices\" from https://www.asha.org/policy/rp2004-00195/","category":"page"},{"location":"journal07/","page":"Reading / Journal 7","title":"Reading / Journal 7","text":"As you think about what your data might mean, remember, as I see it, there are four parts to this picture:","category":"page"},{"location":"journal07/","page":"Reading / Journal 7","title":"Reading / Journal 7","text":"What you are looking AT: There's something in real life that you want to know about. But, you can't know about everything, so you have to choose something to look AT: some subreddit to scrape, some population to interview, etc. You should be able to give me an overall description of your \"AT\" to set the context. If you say that something is interesting or stands out, I gotta know the \"norm\" that it is standing out from. And that comes from your \"AT\".\nWhat you are looking FOR: Not every single detail of what you might observe or measure or so on in your AT will help you answer your research question. And if you are using data that someone else collected, know that their research question was different, so what they included in their data might not be exactly what you want. Either way, there is something about your real life picture that you care to know more about, so you look FOR details/measurements/descriptions/etc. about that thing. And if you don't look FOR it, you can't conclude about it.\nThe REAL LIFE view of the data: The real life component is why we care about your interest in the first place. This is open-ended. This is defeasible. This is the actual data. I could disagree with you about these points, about what this data might mean, and yet you convince me otherwise.\nThe REPRESENTATION view of the data: How we record information, and what Python can look at and understand, is limited. When we represent someone's address as a GPS coordinate, we are making a decision as a researcher. We lose all the data about how big their yard is, what games their kids like to play, which one of their family friends helped them paint when they first moved in, where are the best spots to hide easter eggs for the kids of the neighborhood to find, etc. Those memories might be important to the folks living there. But maybe ignoring that is fine (rude, but fine) for the research question we have. Unlike the REAL LIFE view, I'm not going to disagree with you about where on Earth a particular GPS coordinate is. But, I might disagree with you that what your REPRESENTATION ignored was actually important after all.","category":"page"},{"location":"journal07/","page":"Reading / Journal 7","title":"Reading / Journal 7","text":"Notice I mention \"ignoring\" a lot.
