Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering,
indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner
(Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had
brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further
outdoor exercise was now out of the question.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons:
dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and
toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by
the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana
Reed.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the
drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings
about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.
Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, &ldquo;She regretted to
be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard
from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring
in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more
attractive and sprightly manner&mdash;something lighter, franker, more natural,
as it were&mdash;she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for
contented, happy, little children.&rdquo;",0.0,1.0

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a
bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be
one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet,
I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain
nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were
the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear
November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied
the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and
cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain
sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"I returned to my book&mdash;Bewick&rsquo;s History of British Birds: the
letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a
blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of &ldquo;the
solitary rocks and promontories&rdquo; by them only inhabited; of the coast of
Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze,
to the North Cape&mdash;",0.0,0.0

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with &ldquo;the vast
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,&mdash;that
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of
centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the
pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.&rdquo; Of these
death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the
half-comprehended notions that float dim through children&rsquo;s brains, but
strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected
themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock
standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on
a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud
at a wreck just sinking.",0.0,0.0

she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s lace

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I
was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin;
thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities.
He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a
dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but
his mama had taken him home for a month or two, &ldquo;on account of his
delicate health.&rdquo; Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very
well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the
mother&rsquo;s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to
the more refined idea that John&rsquo;s sallowness was owing to
over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me.
He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or
twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every
morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I
was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever
against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to
offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was
blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me,

behind her back.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,I,"Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging
the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on
the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder
if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he
struck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium
retired back a step or two from his chair.",0.0,0.0

received him in frantic sort. I don&rsquo;t very well know what I did with my

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,II,"The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never,
indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it
necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one
of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on
massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out
like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds
always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery;
the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson
cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the
wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.
Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up
mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.
Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the
bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a
pale throne.",0.0,0.0

mirrors and the furniture a week&rsquo;s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at
far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in
the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a

varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great
looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I
was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I
got up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I
had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily
explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary
hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with
a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving
where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like

one&rsquo;s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.
Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and
insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink cheeks and
golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he
twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at
the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off
the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother &ldquo;old
girl,&rdquo; too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own;
bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk

with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them; a
heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in
propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding
to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at
their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a
sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child&mdash;though
equally dependent and friendless&mdash;Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,II,"Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o&rsquo;clock, and the
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain still
beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove
behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank.
My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on
the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be
so; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death?
That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under
the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been
told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I
dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he
was my own uncle&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s brother&mdash;that he had taken me
when a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had
required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of
her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and
so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could
she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after
her husband&rsquo;s death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find
herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a
strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently
intruded on her own family group.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,II,"A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not&mdash;never doubted&mdash;that
if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat
looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls&mdash;occasionally also turning
a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror&mdash;I began to recall what
I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their
last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the
oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed&rsquo;s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his
sister&rsquo;s child, might quit its abode&mdash;whether in the church vault or
in the unknown world of the departed&mdash;and rise before me in this chamber.
I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief
might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some
haloed face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured
to stifle it&mdash;I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I
lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a
light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon
penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and this
stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head.
I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood,
a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared
as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the
swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My
heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the
rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated:
endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate
effort. Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and

muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an
all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I became

was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from
me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another
followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds
were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too,
was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither,
putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a
word of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a
paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and
thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that
no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.",0.0,1.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,III,"Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart on a
certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a
wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most
enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often petitioned to be
allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always
hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now
placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate
pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and
often wished for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the
bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word <i>book</i> acted as a
transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels from the
library. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it
a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what
I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among
foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling
old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they
were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder
and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag
being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth&rsquo;s surface, I doubted not
that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little
fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and
birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this
cherished volume was now placed in my hand&mdash;when I turned over its leaves,
and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed
to find&mdash;all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the
pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most
dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse,

appalling, her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young
ladies were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings

hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of
this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent
nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had
not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely
noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have
deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing
them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and
gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to
take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper&rsquo;s
room, generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on
my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that
nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to
a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To this crib I always
took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier
objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a
faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to
remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying
it alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my
night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy,
believing it to be happy likewise.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,IV,"Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
listened for the sound of Bessie&rsquo;s step on the stairs: sometimes she
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps
to bring me something by way of supper&mdash;a bun or a cheese-cake&mdash;then
she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she would
tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said, &ldquo;Good
night, Miss Jane.&rdquo; When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best,
prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she
would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or
task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I
think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she
did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the
impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my
recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a slim
young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear
complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of
principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else
at Gateshead Hall.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,IV,"It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning:
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to
their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed
her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling
the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained.
She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only
in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the
gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary
having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her
parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if
she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first
secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of
these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day
losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a
usurious rate of interest&mdash;fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she
exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
accuracy.",0.0,0.0

orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now
frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust
the chairs, &amp;c.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went
to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll&rsquo;s house
furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her
playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups,
were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other
occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was
fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out

frost.",0.0,0.0

through. I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often
came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it
stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was
admitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier
attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped
on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the
casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and

intent: from where I stood I could see the title&mdash;it was
&ldquo;Rasselas;&rdquo; a name that struck me as strange, and consequently
attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her

The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so
great a girl&mdash;she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show
signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor
blushed: composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes.

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,VI,"In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been a
spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein.
At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me
both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered
me; and I was glad when, about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith
put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle,
thimble, &amp;c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with
directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others were sewing
likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd&rsquo;s chair reading,
and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together
with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history:
among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the
commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class, but for
some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly
sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd
continued to make her an object of constant notice: she was continually
addressing to her such phrases as the following:&mdash;",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,VI,"&ldquo;Burns&rdquo; (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called
by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), &ldquo;Burns, you are standing on

were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of
them appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved
instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the
substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I
kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of
that, she suddenly cried out&mdash;",0.0,0.0

Scatcherd&rsquo;s movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just
delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately
left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept,
returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together
at one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful
curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and
the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with
the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns&rsquo; eye; and, while I paused

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,VII,"During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their
melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden
walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour
every day in the open air. Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the
severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our
ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I
remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every
evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,
and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils:
whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace
the little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between two
claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after
relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have
swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me

replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the
body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the
spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude
under the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be
mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of
referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of
martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His
disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall
not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God; to His divine consolations, &lsquo;If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My

origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited
public indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the
quantity and quality of the children&rsquo;s food; the brackish, fetid water
used in its preparation; the pupils&rsquo; wretched clothing and

combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with

tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my

rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road
winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two;

age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and
I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs.

liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed
scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler

the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I
really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in
to read to me sometimes; but I don&rsquo;t think the poor girl liked the task
much: she felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine

latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened
looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and

bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse

thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my
further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly

fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and
pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change

by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of
appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished
to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would
permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to
have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be
tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I
was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why
had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I
could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical,
natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on
my black frock&mdash;which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of
fitting to a nicety&mdash;and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I
should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new

table, I ventured forth.",0.0,0.0

then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on
the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady
with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the
ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon
black with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to
me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was
half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn
morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green
fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
considerable: a gentleman&rsquo;s manor-house, not a nobleman&rsquo;s seat:
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front stood out
well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the
wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from
which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old
thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology
of the mansion&rsquo;s designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty
as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from
the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace
Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the
stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with
trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district
stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
house and gates.",0.0,0.0

interesting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the
lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed:

hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange
carvings of palm branches and cherubs&rsquo; heads, like types of the Hebrew
ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more
antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced
embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.

the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the
field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere,
divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with
foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in
the autumn day&rsquo;s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure,
marbled with pearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all
was pleasing. When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could
scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared

trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie&rsquo;s Gytrash&mdash;a lion-like
creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough;

Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XII,"Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could
see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and
steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points
of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with
stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful
and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age;
perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness.
Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared
to stand thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services
unasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to
one. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I
should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy

it <i>was</i> an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet
it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help had been
needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something;
trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was
weary of an existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture
introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others
hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was
dark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and
slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill
all the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round
and listened, with an idea that a horse&rsquo;s hoofs might ring on the
causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland
dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before
me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the
faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile
distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me

excitement wakened by my walk,&mdash;to slip again over my faculties the
viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose
very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating.

experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XIII,"These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and
livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too,
was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One
gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a
cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold
bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my
palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.
Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green

been washed or torn.",0.0,0.0

combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were
seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair
streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.

the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening
Star.",0.0,0.0

colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin
hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower
features a sable veil; a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow
and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were
visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery,
vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,
gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was &ldquo;the

a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant?
for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XIII,"&ldquo;Why, no&mdash;perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings
between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and
perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of
money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to
diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward
should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon
after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a
great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr.
Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his
fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but
his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very
forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an
unsettled kind of life. I don&rsquo;t think he has ever been resident at
Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a
will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old
place.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

doubt,&rsquo; thought I: &lsquo;let me prepare an ambush.&rsquo; So putting my
hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an
opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement,
all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers&rsquo;
whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair
came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. CÃ©line&rsquo;s
chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The
couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there
was &lsquo;the Varens,&rsquo; shining in satin and jewels,&mdash;my gifts of
course,&mdash;and there was her companion in an officer&rsquo;s uniform; and I
knew him for a young rouÃ© of a vicomte&mdash;a brainless and vicious
youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating
because I despised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake
Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for
CÃ©line sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such
a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however,
than I, who had been her dupe.",0.0,0.0

brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed energy or wit to
belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their
little way: especially CÃ©line, who even waxed rather brilliant on my
personal defects&mdash;deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom
to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my
&lsquo;<i>beautÃ© m&acirc;le</i>:&rsquo; wherein she differed

them; liberated CÃ©line from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the
vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure
of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as
the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole
crew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette
AdÃ¨le, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be,
though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot
is more like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she
abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I
acknowledged no natural claim on AdÃ¨le&rsquo;s part to be supported by
me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she
was quite destitute, I e&rsquo;en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud
of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of
an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you know
that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps
think differently of your post and protÃ©gÃ©e: you will be coming

in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her
there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some
little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much
noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited
probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had
her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the
utmost. I sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester,
but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was
a pity: if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XV,"It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I
steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was
probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself:
a wealthy Englishman&rsquo;s passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to
him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was
something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly
seized him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his
mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I
meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found
it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my
master&rsquo;s manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in
me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the
first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur:
when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word
and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his
presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I
really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening conferences
were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XV,"I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted

scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale
on which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were
characterised); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered,
in imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following him in thought
through the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious
allusion.",0.0,0.0

sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so
gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to
pine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of
existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XV,"And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many
associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked
to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire. Yet I
had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them
frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every
description: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was
balanced by unjust severity to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably
so; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his
library alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a
morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that
his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say
<i>former</i>, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some
cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies,
higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed,
education instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled

never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon
fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief

position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody
that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master&rsquo;s service.
He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night:
what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me,
too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman
seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so much in
her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not
openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.",0.0,0.0

be contemporary with her master&rsquo;s: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had
lived here many years. I don&rsquo;t think she can ever have been pretty; but,
for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to
compensate for the want of personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an
amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a
former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as
his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a
secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake
off, and dare not disregard?&rdquo; But, having reached this point of

stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their
mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling
about everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I
took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two
and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained
the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated
hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could

dessert was not carried out till after nine; and at ten footmen were still
running to and fro with trays and coffee-cups. I allowed AdÃ¨le to sit up
much later than usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep

her pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted,

attire: when she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking
care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my

features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these
features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with
pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of
almost preternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it

kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their
contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black

side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They
knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their

large marble basin, which I recognised as an ornament of the

Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into
view Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf
tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her
temples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and
feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some
Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the

a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted
astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet;

scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see
her incline her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his

woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss
Ingram&rsquo;s. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;&mdash;the nature of the
pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark
beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the
seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not
genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was
poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil;
no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was
not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never
offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of
sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness
and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she
gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little AdÃ¨le:
pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach
her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of
character&mdash;watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future
bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless
surveillance; and it was from this sagacity&mdash;this guardedness of
his&mdash;this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one&rsquo;s

not like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles so
lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate,
graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting
quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart. I
have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now
while she is so vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was
not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to
accept it&mdash;to answer what he asked without pretension, to address him when
needful without grimace&mdash;and it increased and grew kinder and more genial,
and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please
him when they are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might
be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman
the sun shines on.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XVIII,"I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s project of
marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first discovered
that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced
by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but the longer I considered
the position, education, &amp;c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in
judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas
and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their
class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding
them such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like
him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very
obviousness of the advantages to the husband&rsquo;s own happiness offered by
this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general
adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world
would act as I wished to act.",0.0,0.0

I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It
had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his character: to take the
bad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable
judgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that
had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their
presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.
And as for the vague something&mdash;was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a
designing or a desponding expression?&mdash;that opened upon a careful
observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom
the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me
fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at
intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves.
Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare&mdash;to divine it; and I
thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her

interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in
solemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held
up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror,
according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified
puppets. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two
sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel
Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice
business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and
with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their
by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr.
Rochester and&mdash;because closely connected with him&mdash;Miss Ingram were
the life and soul of the party. If he was absent from the room an hour, a

Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with
the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers
Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after
having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and
Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some
sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from
the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared

sank in oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that

former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of this. It was

there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives,

existence. Mind, I don&rsquo;t say a <i>crime</i>; I am not speaking of
shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator
amenable to the law: my word is <i>error</i>. The results of what you have done
become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain
relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are
miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at
noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of
setting. Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of your memory:
you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure&mdash;I
mean in heartless, sensual pleasure&mdash;such as dulls intellect and blights
feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
banishment: you make a new acquaintance&mdash;how or where no matter: you find
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought
for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh,
healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives, regenerates: you
feel better days come back&mdash;higher wishes, purer feelings; you desire to
recommence your life, and to spend what remains to you of days in a way more
worthy of an immortal being. To attain this end, are you justified in
overleaping an obstacle of custom&mdash;a mere conventional impediment which
neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves?&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I entreated him
rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance. I hated it the first
time I set my eyes on it&mdash;a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would
wail in its cradle all night long&mdash;not screaming heartily like any other
child, but whimpering and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and
notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own
at that age. He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar:
the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed
their dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his
bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the
creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a
workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all resemble his

rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and
water-flags, and a naiad&rsquo;s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXI,"One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did
not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked
away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a
square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers
proceeded actively to fill it with features. Strongly-marked horizontal
eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a
well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a
flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided
cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and
some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for
the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful
working. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and
sombre; the irids lustrous and large. &ldquo;Good! but not quite the
thing,&rdquo; I thought, as I surveyed the effect: &ldquo;they want more force
and spirit;&rdquo; and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might
flash more brilliantly&mdash;a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had
a friend&rsquo;s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young
ladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking
likeness: I was absorbed and content.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXI,"&ldquo;Is that a portrait of some one you know?&rdquo; asked Eliza, who had
approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and
hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very
faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her, or to any
one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her
much, but she called that &ldquo;an ugly man.&rdquo; They both seemed surprised
at my skill. I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a
pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute a
water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a
walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a
confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the
brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago&mdash;of the
admiration she had there excited&mdash;the attention she had received; and I
even got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of the
afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations
were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a
novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit. The
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
theme&mdash;herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she never once
adverted either to her mother&rsquo;s illness, or her brother&rsquo;s death, or
the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken
up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to
come. She passed about five minutes each day in her mother&rsquo;s sick-room,

her up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after
that meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its
allotted task. Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on
inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great
attraction of that volume, and she said, &ldquo;the Rubric.&rdquo; Three hours
she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth,
almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of
this article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church
lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her
accounts. She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe she was

minutes&mdash;include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method,
with rigid regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has
begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
moment: you have had to seek no one&rsquo;s company, conversation, sympathy,
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do.

me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it&mdash;go on as heretofore,
craving, whining, and idling&mdash;and suffer the results of your idiocy,
however bad and insufferable they may be. I tell you this plainly; and listen:

act on it. After my mother&rsquo;s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day
her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as
separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because
we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down

ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXII,"A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
Nothing was said of the master&rsquo;s marriage, and I saw no preparation going
on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet
heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative. Once she said
she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to
bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his
queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXII,"One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles
off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent
lover? To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would
be but a morning&rsquo;s ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to
conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that
one or both parties had changed their minds. I used to look at my
master&rsquo;s face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember
the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in
the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into
inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more
frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me when there&mdash;and, alas!
never had I loved him so well.",0.0,0.0

glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The

furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft

orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full
of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court,
on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the
bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding
walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled
at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one could wander
unseen. While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming
gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the

nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no
coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the

half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it:
no&mdash;it should be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in

would select himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores:
he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink
satin. I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a
gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear
his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and

Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him
now.&rdquo; And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute
that day), I ventured once more to meet my master&rsquo;s and lover&rsquo;s
eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and
gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a

them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed&mdash;the sap

bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears
about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope
of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don&rsquo;t caress me
now&mdash;let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and
believed that events were working together for your good and mine: it was a
fine day, if you recollect&mdash;the calmness of the air and sky forbade
apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey. I walked
a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in
imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence. I thought of
the life that lay before me&mdash;<i>your</i> life, sir&mdash;an existence more
expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to
which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I
wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed
like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in,
Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just
brought; and under it in the box I found your present&mdash;the veil which, in
your princely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose,
since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.
I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the
attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down to you the square of
unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head,
and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband
neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and
heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any
necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by
marrying either a purse or a coronet.&rdquo;",1.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXV,"&ldquo;How well you read me, you witch!&rdquo; interposed Mr. Rochester:
&ldquo;but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find
poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?&rdquo;",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXV,"&ldquo;No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
nothing save Fairfax Rochester&rsquo;s pride; and that did not scare me,
because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark, the
wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now&mdash;wild and
high&mdash;but &lsquo;with a sullen, moaning sound&rsquo; far more eerie.
I wished you were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty
chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I
could not sleep&mdash;a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The
gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet
doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a
distance. I was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I continued in dreams the
idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and
experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us.
During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road;
total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of
a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which
shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I thought, sir, that
you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to
stop&mdash;but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
moment.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing
remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered,
on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled
over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up
in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down
anywhere, however tired were my arms&mdash;however much its weight impeded my
progress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a
distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to
catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet,
the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror,
and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on
a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not
stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap:
you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall
crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell,
and woke.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had
hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked,
&lsquo;Sophie, what are you doing?&rsquo; No one answered; but a form emerged
from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments
pendent from the portmanteau. &lsquo;Sophie! Sophie!&rsquo; I again
cried: and still it was silent. I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first
surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through
my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs.

Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:&mdash;what this lawyer and his client say is
true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say
you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay
you have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic
kept there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my
bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that she is
my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,&mdash;Bertha Mason by name; sister
of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white
cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer up,
Dick!&mdash;never fear me!&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost as soon strike a woman as
you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs
through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a
drunkard!&mdash;as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were
silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her
parent in both points. I had a charming partner&mdash;pure, wise, modest: you
can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has
been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation.
Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
Poole&rsquo;s patient, and <i>my wife</i>! You shall see what sort of a being I
was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the
compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl,&rdquo; he

mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned them behind
her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation

hours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread,
waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all
dead&mdash;struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the
first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never
revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
master&rsquo;s&mdash;which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a
suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could
not seek Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s arms&mdash;it could not derive warmth from his
breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was
blighted&mdash;confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had
been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I
would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone
from his idea, and from his presence I must go: <i>that</i> I perceived well.
When&mdash;how&mdash;whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I
doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he
could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
would want me no more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must
be hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!",0.0,0.0

reflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and
effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river;
I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to
rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead.

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXVII,"&ldquo;Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a
fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. Yet as little
could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must be provided for
by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West
India planter and merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his
possessions were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a
son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the
latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college,
I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father
said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in
the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to
secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me
in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very little
private conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my
pleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to
admire her and envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and
being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the
rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission.
Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage
was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no respect for myself
when I think of that act!&mdash;an agony of inward contempt masters me. I never
loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her. I was not sure of the
existence of one virtue in her nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor
benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her mind or manners&mdash;and, I

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXVII,"&ldquo;To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a

her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she
has now for ten years made a wild beast&rsquo;s den&mdash;a goblin&rsquo;s
cell. I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it was necessary
to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for her ravings
would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of
days&mdash;sometimes weeks&mdash;which she filled up with abuse of me. At last
I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who
dressed Mason&rsquo;s wounds that night he was stabbed and worried), are the
only two I have ever admitted to my confidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed
have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise knowledge as to
facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a
fault of her own, of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is
incident to her harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once
lulled and baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never
failed to take advantage of her guardian&rsquo;s temporary lapses; once to
secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to possess
herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time. On the
first of these occasions, she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on
the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you. I thank Providence, who
watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which
perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXVII,"&ldquo;I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her

For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another:
sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples,
and Florence. Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I
could choose my own society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my
ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras,
and German gr&auml;finnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a
fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form,
which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeceived.
You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I
longed only for what suited me&mdash;for the antipodes of the Creole: and I
longed vainly. Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free,
I&mdash;warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous
unions&mdash;would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I
tried dissipation&mdash;never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my
Indian Messalina&rsquo;s attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach
me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXVII,"&ldquo;Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
The first I chose was CÃ©line Varens&mdash;another of those steps which
make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already know what she was,
and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two successors: an Italian,
Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was
their beauty to me in a few weeks? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent:
I tired of her in three months. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy,
mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a
sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently
rid of her. But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable
opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake:
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

Abhorred spot! I expected no peace&mdash;no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay

as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it
would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life&mdash;my genius
for good or evil&mdash;waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even
when, on the occasion of Mesrour&rsquo;s accident, it came up and gravely
offered me help. Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had
hopped to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but
the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked
and spoke with a sort of authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and
aided I was.",0.0,0.0

sap and sense&mdash;stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf
must return to me&mdash;that it belonged to my house down below&mdash;or I
could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come home that night, Jane,
though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you.
The next day I observed you&mdash;myself unseen&mdash;for half-an-hour, while
you played with AdÃ¨le in the gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect,
and you could not go out of doors. I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could
both listen and watch. AdÃ¨le claimed your outward attention for a while;
yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her,
my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she
left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to
pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the
thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced
gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your
aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look
revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing
wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs.
Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you
smiled to and at yourself, Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was
very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to
say&mdash;&lsquo;My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they
are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain;
but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and
around me gather black tempests to encounter.&rsquo; You ran downstairs and
demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up,
or something of that sort, I think it was. I was vexed with you for getting out
of my sight.",0.0,1.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXVII,"&ldquo;Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
presence. An unusual&mdash;to me&mdash;a perfectly new character I suspected
was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered
the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
dressed&mdash;much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I found you full
of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air
was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but
absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself
disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed,
you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor&rsquo;s
face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by
close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed
to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and
your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a
certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed
no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me,
and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot
describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I
had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time, I treated you
distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an intellectual epicure, and
wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant
acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if
I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade&mdash;the sweet charm of
freshness would leave it. I did not then know that it was no transitory
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible
gem. Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned
you&mdash;but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk
and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little
token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression
in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not
sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure. I
wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to
find this out.",0.0,0.0

mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred
emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked
my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a
chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in
your manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble&mdash;a hovering doubt:
you did not know what my caprice might be&mdash;whether I was going to play the
master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you
often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially,
such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much
ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field,
I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards it. Near the churchyard,
and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I
had no doubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a
place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to
the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman&rsquo;s function to
help&mdash;at least with advice&mdash;those who wished to help themselves. I
seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my
courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached
the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was

frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be
sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me
with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first

I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the

rough stones of a low wall&mdash;above it, something like palisades, and
within, a high and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed

from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the
ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant,
whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was
set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been
deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a
sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in
rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a
clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my

severity. A stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes,
to which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them
in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had
been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could
hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and

near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was my
mother&rsquo;s brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by his
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and
were never reconciled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous
undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He
was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person,
not more closely related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he
would atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs
us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception
of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for
the purchase of three mourning rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he
pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such
news. Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds

difficulty in understanding each other&rsquo;s language. Some of them are
unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile,
have a wish to learn, and evince a disposition that pleases me. I must not

as the scions of gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence,
refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts

orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician,
of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power,

the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had
surprised him&mdash;his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the
west. He turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to
me, had risen at his side. There appeared, within three feet of him, a form
clad in pure white&mdash;a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour;
and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back
a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect
beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet
features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose
and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened,
justified, in this instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped
and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the
long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination;
the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which
adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval,
fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the
even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of
rich, plenteous tresses&mdash;all advantages, in short, which, combined,
realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this
fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed her

could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all my
efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature. Wholly
untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and,
at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a
difference amongst them as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them,
and they me, this difference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me,
my language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these
heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many
showed themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not
a few examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These soon
took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in
learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The
rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an
honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began personally to like some
of the best girls; and they liked me. I had amongst my scholars several
farmers&rsquo; daughters: young women grown, almost. These could already read,
write, and sew; and to them I taught the elements of grammar, geography,
history, and the finer kinds of needlework. I found estimable characters
amongst them&mdash;characters desirous of information and disposed for
improvement&mdash;with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own
homes. Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.
There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it
by a consideration&mdash;a scrupulous regard to their feelings&mdash;to which
they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it made them
emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.",0.0,0.0

like &ldquo;sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;&rdquo; serene inward feelings
bud and bloom under the ray. At this period of my life, my heart far oftener
swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell
you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence&mdash;after a day
passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing
or reading contentedly alone&mdash;I used to rush into strange dreams at night:
dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the
stormy&mdash;dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with
agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester,
always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms,
hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him,
being loved by him&mdash;the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be
renewed, with all its first force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where
I was, and how situated. Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and
quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair,

exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon&rsquo;s cap
of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek
and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she
would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the
village children. She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in
giving his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the
visitress pierce the young pastor&rsquo;s heart. A sort of instinct
seemed to warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he
was looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would
glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed

learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: she was
coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. She had
been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but
good-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass
showed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed;
innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay,
lively, and unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool
observer of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or
thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for
instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I liked my

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXIII,"&ldquo;Twenty years ago, a poor curate&mdash;never mind his name at this
moment&mdash;fell in love with a rich man&rsquo;s daughter; she fell in love
with him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who
consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two years
passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one
slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
manufacturing town in &mdash;&mdash;shire.) They left a daughter, which, at its
very birth, Charity received in her lap&mdash;cold as that of the snow-drift I
almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried the friendless thing to the
house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-law, called
(I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You start&mdash;did you hear a
noise? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining
schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are
generally haunted by rats.&mdash;To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten
years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been
told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you
know&mdash;being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided
yourself. It seems her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she
became a teacher, like yourself&mdash;really it strikes me there are parallel

left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had been

given me <i>carte blanche</i> to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum

I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure
from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the
spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to
give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark
handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected
antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and

still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and
water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of
her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she had nearly burnt
her husband in his bed once: but I don&rsquo;t know about that. However,

then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the chamber that had
been the governess&rsquo;s&mdash;(she was like as if she knew somehow how
matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)&mdash;and she kindled the bed
there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately. The governess had run
away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been
the most precious thing he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her;
and he grew savage&mdash;quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a
wild man, but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He
sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he
did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved

before him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash&mdash;all fell.
He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen
in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one
hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The
other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that also. He is now helpless,

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVII,"The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate
size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. I had heard of
it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His
father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers. He would have
let the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and
insalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the
exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the
squire when he went there in the season to shoot.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVII,"To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics
of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain. The last mile I
performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double
remuneration I had promised. Even when within a very short distance of the
manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of
the gloomy wood about it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to
enter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of
close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle
between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it,
expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVII,"I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness of

summer foliage&mdash;no opening anywhere.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVII,"I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I
beheld a railing, then the house&mdash;scarce, by this dim light,
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls.
Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed
ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no
flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and
this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed
gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was
narrow too, one step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the
Rochester Arms had said, &ldquo;quite a desolate spot.&rdquo; It was as still

be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his countenance I saw a

with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one
saw that all to him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left
arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by
touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the
trees were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded

re-lit&mdash;and alas! it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of

dies unreverberating. &lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo; seemed spoken amongst
mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at
the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have
met. You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your

return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as must

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVIII&mdash;CONCLUSION,"You have not quite forgotten little AdÃ¨le, have you, reader? I had not;
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the
school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me
much. She looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy. I found the rules
of the establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a
child of her age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once
more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required
by another&mdash;my husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted
on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often,
and bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything
that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became
very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a
sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and
when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile,
good-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine,
she has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to
offer her.",0.0,0.0

Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVIII&mdash;CONCLUSION,"I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and
with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest&mdash;blest
beyond what language can express; because I am my husband&rsquo;s life as fully
as he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more
absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my
Edward&rsquo;s society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the
pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are
ever together. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude,
as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other
is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed
on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in
character&mdash;perfect concord is the result.",0.0,0.0
Jane Eyre,Charlotte Bronte,XXXVIII&mdash;CONCLUSION,"Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was
that circumstance that drew us so very near&mdash;that knit us so very close:
for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand. Literally, I was (what
he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw nature&mdash;he saw books
through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into
words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam&mdash;of the
landscape before us; of the weather round us&mdash;and impressing by sound on
his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of
reading to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go: of
doing for him what he wished to be done. And there was a pleasure in my
services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad&mdash;because he claimed
these services without painful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so
truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I
loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest
wishes.",0.0,0.0

led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him&mdash;the earth no longer
a void. When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy
had inherited his own eyes, as they once were&mdash;large, brilliant, and

husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man.

path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute,
indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful,
and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he
clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the
prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be
exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior
Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.
His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he
says&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take
up his cross and follow me.&rdquo; His is the ambition of the high
master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are

yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his
incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger&rsquo;s hand will write to me next,
to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the
joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St.

guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by the excessive
slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.

Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,I,"One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory
lobby or passage: they call it here &ldquo;the house&rdquo; pre-eminently. It
includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the
kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I
distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep
within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge
fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.
One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense
pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after
row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been
under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a
frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and
ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a
couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted
canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the
chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy
black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge,
liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and
other dogs haunted other recesses.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,I,"The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging
to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs
set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in
his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be
seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the
right time after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his
abode and style of living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and
manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:
rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he
has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose. Possibly, some people
might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord
within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by instinct, his
reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling&mdash;to
manifestations of mutual kindliness. He&rsquo;ll love and hate equally under
cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No,
I&rsquo;m running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on
him. Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand
out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate
me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say

thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for a
guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on, my
companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a
pilgrim&rsquo;s staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without
one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to be
so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a
weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new idea flashed across
me. I was not going there: we were journeying to hear the famous Jabez
Branderham preach, from the text&mdash;&ldquo;Seventy Times Seven;&rdquo; and
either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the &ldquo;First of the
Seventy-First,&rdquo; and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.",0.0,0.0

lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose
peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few
corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the
clergyman&rsquo;s stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a house with two
rooms, threatening speedily to determine into one, no clergyman will undertake
the duties of pastor: especially as it is currently reported that his flock
would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their
own pockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation;
and he preached&mdash;good God! what a sermon; divided into <i>four hundred and
ninety</i> parts, each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and
each discussing a separate sin! Where he searched for them, I cannot tell. He
had his private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the
brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the most

condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the &ldquo;<i>First of the

blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded
with rappings and counter rappings: every man&rsquo;s hand was against his
neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a
shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly

to her story&mdash;I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother
had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton&rsquo;s father, and I got
used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make hay,
and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to. One
fine summer morning&mdash;it was the beginning of harvest, I remember&mdash;Mr.
Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he
had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and
Cathy, and me&mdash;for I sat eating my porridge with them&mdash;and he said,
speaking to his son, &ldquo;Now, my bonny man, I&rsquo;m going to Liverpool
to-day, what shall I bring you? You may choose what you like: only let it be
little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way, that is a long
spell!&rdquo; Hindley named a fiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was
hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose
a whip. He did not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather
severe sometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and
then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.",0.0,0.0

of running down to the gate to look. Then it grew dark; she would have had them
to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven

ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its face
looked older than Catherine&rsquo;s; yet when it was set on its feet, it only
stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could
understand. I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of
doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat
into the house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for? What he
meant to do with it, and whether he were mad? The master tried to explain the
matter; but he was really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make
out, amongst her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless,
and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and
inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his
money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with
him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he
would not leave it as he found it. Well, the conclusion was, that my mistress
grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean

drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat, he
blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had lost her whip in
attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the
stupid little thing; earning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to
teach her cleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them,
or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of
the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted
by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s door, and there he found

few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I found
they had christened him &ldquo;Heathcliff&rdquo;: it was the name of a son who
died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian and
surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated him: and to
say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully:

never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.",0.0,0.0

himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This endurance made old Earnshaw
furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child, as
he called him. He took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that
matter, he said precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up
far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.",0.0,1.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,IV,"So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at Mrs.
Earnshaw&rsquo;s death, which happened in less than two years after, the young
master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend,
and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent&rsquo;s affections and his
privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries. I sympathised
a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them,
and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was
dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by
his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn&rsquo;t
wit to guess that I was compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was
the quietest child that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and
the others forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me
terribly: he was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness,
made him give little trouble.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,IV,"He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me,

towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley lost his last
ally: still I couldn&rsquo;t dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my
master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never, to my recollection,
repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude. He was not insolent to his
benefactor, he was simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had
on his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be
obliged to bend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once
bought a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.

the stable): &ldquo;you will have to: and if I speak of these blows,

I&rsquo;ll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as
he died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly.&rdquo; Hindley
threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered up
immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I prevented it, he would have
gone just so to the master, and got full revenge by letting his condition plead
for him, intimating who had caused it. &ldquo;Take my colt, Gipsy, then!&rdquo;
said young Earnshaw. &ldquo;And I pray that he may break your neck: take him,

away as fast as he could. I was surprised to witness how coolly the child
gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging saddles and
all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the
violent blow occasioned, before he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to
let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale
was told since he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such

slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This was especially to be
remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or domineer over, his favourite:
he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to
have got into his head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated,
and longed to do him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the
kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality;
and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child&rsquo;s pride and black
tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,

on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two people&mdash;Miss Cathy, and Joseph,
the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up yonder. He was, and is yet most likely,
the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the
promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his knack of
sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on
Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he
gained. He was relentless in worrying him about his soul&rsquo;s concerns, and
about ruling his children rigidly. He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a

she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep
you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was
much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her
was to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us on

Joseph&rsquo;s religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what

came fondling to make it up at night. &ldquo;Nay, Cathy,&rdquo; the old man

her lap. I remember the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny
hair&mdash;it pleased him rarely to see her gentle&mdash;and saying, &ldquo;Why
canst thou not always be a good lass, Cathy?&rdquo; And she turned her face up
to his, and laughed, and answered, &ldquo;Why cannot you always be a good man,
father?&rdquo; But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and
said she would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his fingers
dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told her to hush,

half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph, having finished his
chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed. He
stepped forward, and called him by name, and touched his shoulder; but he would
not move: so he took the candle and looked at him. I thought there was

negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him. He
would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays, only Joseph

that reminded him to order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from

the middle of the table sat a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which,
from their mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two
between them. The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a
heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get
it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did
despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted? or
find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and
rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I&rsquo;d not exchange, for a
thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton&rsquo;s at Thrushcross
Grange&mdash;not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the
highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;",0.0,1.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VI,"&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;Still you have not told me,
Heathcliff, how Catherine is left behind?&rdquo;",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VI,"&ldquo;I told you we laughed,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The Lintons heard us,
and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and
then a cry, &lsquo;Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa,
oh!&rsquo; They really did howl out something in that way. We made frightful
noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge, because
somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I had Cathy by
the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell down. &lsquo;Run,
Heathcliff, run!&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;They have let the bull-dog loose,
and he holds me!&rsquo; The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard his
abominable snorting. She did not yell out&mdash;no! she would have scorned to
do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I did, though: I
vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom; and I got a
stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it
down his throat. A beast of a servant came up with a lantern, at last,
shouting&mdash;&lsquo;Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!&rsquo; He changed his
note, however, when he saw Skulker&rsquo;s game. The dog was throttled off; his
huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips
streaming with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from
fear, I&rsquo;m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed,
grumbling execrations and vengeance. &lsquo;What prey, Robert?&rsquo; hallooed
Linton from the entrance. &lsquo;Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,&rsquo;
he replied; &lsquo;and there&rsquo;s a lad here,&rsquo; he added, making a
clutch at me, &lsquo;who looks an out-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for
putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were
asleep, that they might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you
foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir,
don&rsquo;t lay by your gun.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no, Robert,&rsquo; said the old
fool. &lsquo;The rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to
have me cleverly. Come in; I&rsquo;ll furnish them a reception. There, John,
fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his
stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop? Oh, my
dear Mary, look here! Don&rsquo;t be afraid, it is but a boy&mdash;yet the
villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to the
country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as well as
features?&rsquo; He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her
spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The cowardly children
crept nearer also, Isabella lisping&mdash;&lsquo;Frightful thing! Put him in
the cellar, papa. He&rsquo;s exactly like the son of the fortune-teller that
stole my tame pheasant. Isn&rsquo;t he, Edgar?&rsquo;",0.0,1.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VI,"&ldquo;While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and
laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to
recognise her. They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet them
elsewhere. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Earnshaw?&rsquo; he whispered to his
mother, &lsquo;and look how Skulker has bitten her&mdash;how her foot

her grow up in absolute heathenism. But who is this? Where did she pick up this

Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VI,"&ldquo;I recommenced cursing&mdash;don&rsquo;t be angry, Nelly&mdash;and so
Robert was ordered to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me
into the garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw
should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly, secured the
door again. The curtains were still looped up at one corner, and I resumed my
station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended
shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they let
her out. She sat on the sofa quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of
the dairy-maid which we had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and
expostulating with her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a
distinction between her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a
basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of
negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood
gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and
gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I left
her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little dog and
Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in
the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons&mdash;a dim reflection from her own
enchanting face. I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she is so
immeasurably superior to them&mdash;to everybody on earth, is she not,
Nelly?&rdquo;",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VI,"&ldquo;There will more come of this business than you reckon on,&rdquo; I
answered, covering him up and extinguishing the light. &ldquo;You are
incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see
if he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; My words came truer than I desired. The luckless
adventure made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us
a visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on the
road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in earnest.
Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke
to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to
keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned home; employing art,
not force: with force she would have found it impossible.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VII,"Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that time her
ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The mistress visited
her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise
her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she took readily; so
that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and
rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there &ldquo;lighted from a handsome
black pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover
of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up
with both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse,
exclaiming delightedly, &ldquo;Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should
scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is not to be
compared with her, is she, Frances?&rdquo; &ldquo;Isabella has not her natural
advantages,&rdquo; replied his wife: &ldquo;but she must mind and not grow wild
again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things&mdash;Stay, dear,

white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when
the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they
should fawn upon her splendid garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour
making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and
then she looked round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously
their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what

Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VII,"Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and uncared

Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him
wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural
pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention his clothes, which had
seen three months&rsquo; service in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair,
the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded. He might well skulk
behind the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house,

alone; regardless of Joseph&rsquo;s affirmations that he considered the merry
tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had retired to private prayer in his
chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging Missy&rsquo;s attention by
sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little Lintons, as an
acknowledgment of their kindness. They had invited them to spend the morrow at

mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular
care&mdash;the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave due inward applause to
every object, and then I remembered how old Earnshaw used to come in when all
was tidied, and call me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a
Christmas-box; and from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff,
and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and
that naturally led me to consider the poor lad&rsquo;s situation now, and from
singing I changed my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be
more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears
over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was not far; I
found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding
the other beasts, according to custom.",0.0,1.0

work till nine o&rsquo;clock, and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber.
Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to order for the reception of her
new friends: she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was
gone, and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went
back. In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his
ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for
church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.

carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their

myself; &ldquo;how lightly she dismisses her old playmate&rsquo;s troubles. I

her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed

horns, and a bass viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the

never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made no stay at the
stairs&rsquo;-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where Heathcliff was
confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined answering for a while: she
persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the
boards. I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs
were going to cease, and the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered
up the ladder to warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice
within. The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the
roof, into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I
could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she
insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone
to a neighbour&rsquo;s, to be removed from the sound of our
&ldquo;devil&rsquo;s psalmody,&rdquo; as it pleased him to call it. I told them
I intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had never
broken his fast since yesterday&rsquo;s dinner, I would wink at his cheating
Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the fire, and offered
him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and could eat little, and my
attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He leant his two elbows on his
knees, and his chin on his hands and remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my
inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered

setting a hungry man down to a single dish, on which he may concentrate his

degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable for savage
sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell what an infernal house we had.
The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless
Edgar Linton&rsquo;s visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception. At fifteen she
was the queen of the country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a
haughty, headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;
and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never
took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to old
attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and
young Linton, with all his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally
deep impression. He was my late master: that is his portrait over the

old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of

her from the first&mdash;for she was full of ambition&mdash;and led her to
adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one. In the

Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VIII,"Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He had a
terror of Earnshaw&rsquo;s reputation, and shrunk from encountering him; and
yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the master
himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be
gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his appearance there was
distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never played the coquette, and
had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all; for when
Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half
coincide, as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and
antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference,
as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.
I&rsquo;ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she
vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but she was so
proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be
chastened into more humility. She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and
to confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an

Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,VIII,"Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to give
himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age of sixteen
then, I think, and without having bad features, or being deficient in
intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward
repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of. In the first place,
he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education: continual hard
work, begun soon and concluded late, had extinguished any curiosity he once
possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and any love for books or learning. His
childhood&rsquo;s sense of superiority, instilled into him by the favours of
old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with
Catherine in her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but
he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the
way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his
former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration:
he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved
disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable
moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion

before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing
nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not
reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle; and imagining she would

be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to

up a permanent situation on one side of the wall, near the road: where,
heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops

the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a huge bough fell
across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending
a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had
fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the
Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare
the righteous, though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must
be a judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook
the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living. He replied
audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more
clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints
like himself and sinners like his master. But the uproar passed away in twenty
minutes, leaving us all unharmed; excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched
for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and
shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She

exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it
belonged, as she well knew. From that period, for several months, she ceased to
hold any communication with me, save in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph
fell under a ban also: he would speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as
if she were a little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress,
and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with
consideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much;
she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes
for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and
his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a
fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased
to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was rather
too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from pride: he
wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the
Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves,
for aught he cared! Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be

choice left: to do as I was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent

disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to expect. She
seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his sister she showed plenty
of affection. They were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly. It was
not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the
thorn. There were no mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others
yielded: and who can be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter
neither opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a
deep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but if ever
he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some
imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure
that never darkened on his own account. He many a time spoke sternly to me
about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a
worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind
master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the
gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it.
Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected
with sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration in
her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never subject to

Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and, finding him
plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again in the evening: to
which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance
prudently: he doesn&rsquo;t trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might
have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his
principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a
wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an
attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope that I
shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he
settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge

male, might pass into such a one&rsquo;s power, he had sense to comprehend
Heathcliff&rsquo;s disposition: to know that, though his exterior was altered,

sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.
I&rsquo;ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people
talked regarding his ways; and then I&rsquo;ve recollected his confirmed bad

Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XI,"One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to Gimmerton.
It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a bright frosty
afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I came to a stone where
the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a rough sand-pillar,
with the letters W. H. cut on its north side, on the east, G., and on the
south-west, T. G. It serves as a guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and
village. The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I
cannot say why, but all at once a gush of child&rsquo;s sensations flowed into
my heart. Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed
long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the
bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing
there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I
beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark, square head
bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.
&ldquo;Poor Hindley!&rdquo; I exclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily
eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and
stared straight into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt
an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to comply
with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought&mdash;or should die
soon!&mdash;supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to the house
the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb.
The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was
my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy
countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be

grieved more than angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and
offered it to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold;

precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house-front. I was standing by
the kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight. He then stepped across the

getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face:

desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness overwhelmed
me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn&rsquo;t explain to Edgar how certain I
felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me! I had
no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps: it
barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice. Before I
recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly,
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring
till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against
that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window,
that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with
some great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and
worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole
last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been
at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from the
separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was laid
alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of
weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the table-top! I
swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my late anguish was
swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched:
it must have been temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But,
supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every
early association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been
converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the
wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my
world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head
as you will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to
Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I&rsquo;m
burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage
and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am
I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?
I&rsquo;m sure I should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills.

compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my
wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects. An unexpected aid presently
appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old
Skulker: it had spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father
to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of
salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to
step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk
from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely over
when I heard Earnshaw&rsquo;s tread in the passage; my assistant tucked in his
tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway. The
dog&rsquo;s endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter
downstairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on,
entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with
Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton&rsquo;s room, and

looking through the lattice as I came up the garden causeway, and I nodded to
her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being observed. I entered without
knocking. There never was such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly cheerful
house presented! I must confess, that if I had been in the young lady&rsquo;s
place, I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a
duster. But she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which
encompassed her. Her pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some
locks hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably
she had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there. Mr.
Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-book; but he
rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered me a
chair. He was the only thing there that seemed decent; and I thought he never
looked better. So much had circumstances altered their positions, that he would
certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as
a thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held out
one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn&rsquo;t
understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay my
bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I had brought.

creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my
character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at last, I
think she begins to know me: I don&rsquo;t perceive the silly smiles and
grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of
discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation
and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did
not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons could teach her that! And yet
it is poorly learnt; for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling
intelligence, that I had actually succeeded in making her hate me! A positive
labour of Hercules, I assure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return
thanks. Can I trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I
let you alone for half a day, won&rsquo;t you come sighing and wheedling to me
again? I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it
wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don&rsquo;t care who knows
that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it.
She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. The first thing
she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and
when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the
hanging of every being belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that
exception for herself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an
innate admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!
Now, was it not the depth of absurdity&mdash;of genuine idiocy, for that
pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her? Tell your
master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as
she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I&rsquo;ve sometimes
relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on what she could
endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But tell him, also, to set
his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the
limits of the law. I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest
right to claim a separation; and, what&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;d thank nobody

partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that
sentiment for him, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to
make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing
I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I&rsquo;ve

said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get

kissed Edgar&rsquo;s and Catherine&rsquo;s portraits, bestowed a similar salute
on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild
with joy at recovering her mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this
neighbourhood: but a regular correspondence was established between her and my
master when things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south,
near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape. He
was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing,
peevish creature.",1.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XVII,"Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she lived. I
refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment, only she must
beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep
her himself. Though I would give no information, he discovered, through some of
the other servants, both her place of residence and the existence of the child.
Still, he didn&rsquo;t molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his
aversion, I suppose. He often asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on

speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for discussing
nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister
had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of
his nature would scarcely seem to allow. So deep and sensitive was his
aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or
hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that together, transformed him into a complete
hermit: he threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church,
avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion
within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on
the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early
morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good to be
thoroughly unhappy long. <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t pray for Catherine&rsquo;s soul
to haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common
joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to
the better world; where he doubted not she was gone.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XVII,"And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I said, he
seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that coldness melted
as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter
a step it wielded a despot&rsquo;s sceptre in his heart. It was named
Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had never called the
first Catherine short: probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The
little one was always Cathy: it formed to him a distinction from the mother,
and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to
her, far more than from its being his own.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XVII,"I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex
myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar
circumstances. They had both been fond husbands, and were both attached to
their children; and I could not see how they shouldn&rsquo;t both have taken
the same road, for good or evil. But, I thought in my mind, Hindley, with
apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker
man. When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the crew,
instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope
for their luckless vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage
of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped,
and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed
to endure them. But you&rsquo;ll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood;
you&rsquo;ll judge, as well as I can, all these things: at least, you&rsquo;ll
think you will, and that&rsquo;s the same. The end of Earnshaw was what might
have been expected; it followed fast on his sister&rsquo;s: there were scarcely
six months between them. We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account

to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder myself from pondering on the
question&mdash;&ldquo;Had he had fair play?&rdquo; Whatever I did, that idea
would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that I resolved on
requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to
the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded
eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay; and I said my old
master and foster-brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own.
Besides, I reminded him that the child Hareton was his wife&rsquo;s nephew,
and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he
ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns
of his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he
bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go. His lawyer had
been Earnshaw&rsquo;s also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany
me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone;

indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything, it expressed a flinty
gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed. I observed
once, indeed, something like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the
people were bearing the coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to
represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the

to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. In that
manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was
reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father&rsquo;s inveterate
enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of
wages: quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his
ignorance that he has been wronged.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XVIII,"The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were the
happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little
lady&rsquo;s trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all
children, rich and poor. For the rest, after the first six months, she grew
like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her own way, before the heath
blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s dust. She was the most winning
thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face,
with the Earnshaws&rsquo; handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons&rsquo; fair skin
and small features, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not
rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its
affections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother:
still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and
she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her
love never fierce: it was deep and tender. However, it must be acknowledged,
she had faults to foil her gifts. A propensity to be saucy was one; and a
perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be good
tempered or cross. If a servant chanced to vex her, it was
always&mdash;&ldquo;I shall tell papa!&rdquo; And if he reproved her, even by a
look, you would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don&rsquo;t
believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her. He took her education entirely

I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the same thing, a kind of fever,
slow at its commencement, but incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the
close. She wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a
four-months&rsquo; indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated
him to come to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to
bid him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that
Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would
fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or
education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request:

would scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my
confidence proved misplaced. Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight
o&rsquo;clock, and said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross
the Desert with his caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for
herself and beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and
a couple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung them in
a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy,
sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted
off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and
come back early. The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea. One

the latter&rsquo;s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred. Hareton,
recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed moved by her
distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he took, to
propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the kennel, and
putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought. Pausing in her
lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror, then burst
forth anew.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XVIII,"I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow; who
was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features, and stout and
healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on
the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game. Still, I thought
I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his
father ever possessed. Good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure,
whose rankness far over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding,
evidence of a wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and
favourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him
physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to
that course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would
have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff&rsquo;s judgment. He appeared
to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught to read
or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never
led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice.
And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a
narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy,
because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in the habit of
accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children, of putting the
master past his patience, and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he
termed their &ldquo;offald ways,&rdquo; so at present he laid the whole burden
of Hareton&rsquo;s faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property. If
the lad swore, he wouldn&rsquo;t correct him: nor however culpably he behaved.
It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he
allowed that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but
then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton&rsquo;s blood
would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that
thought. Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he
would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of
the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he
confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private
comminations. I don&rsquo;t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode
of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak from
hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was
<i>near</i>, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house, inside,
had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management, and the
scenes of riot common in Hindley&rsquo;s time were not now enacted within its
walls. The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or
bad; and he is yet.",0.0,0.0

They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly out
of sorts, every one of us. I could not wring from my little lady how she had
spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was
Penistone Crags; and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the
farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine
followers, who attacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners
could separate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who
she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way: finally,
beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and
twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a
description of the interesting objects she saw. I could gather, however, that
her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as
a servant; and Heathcliff&rsquo;s housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her
cousin. Then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was
always &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;darling,&rdquo; and &ldquo;queen,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so
shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to
obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father. I
explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how sorry
he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that
if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that
I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn&rsquo;t bear that prospect: she
pledged her word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little

he&rsquo;s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master
tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome style;
I&rsquo;ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty
miles&rsquo; distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I&rsquo;ve
ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I&rsquo;ve arranged everything with a
view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates. I
do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any

lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never to be seen. I
could gather from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome
inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse,
though he took some trouble to conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of
his voice, and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him
many minutes together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton
learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the
parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and
colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.",0.0,0.0

milk, milk for ever&mdash;heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in

Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him&mdash;Hareton is not bad-natured, though
he&rsquo;s rough&mdash;they&rsquo;re sure to part, one swearing and the other

him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then he

Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally; and my
interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved with a sense
of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with us. Mr. Edgar
encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy,
and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to ask the
housekeeper whether he ever came into the village? She said he had only been
twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be
quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if I

finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from the
village; but that I didn&rsquo;t learn till some time afterwards. Weeks passed
on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond of stealing
off to corners by herself and often, if I came near her suddenly while reading,
she would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I
detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a
trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as
if she were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a
cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key
she took special care to remove when she left it.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XXI,"One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and

her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my master were safe
upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my house keys one that would fit
the lock. Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took
them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but
suspect, I was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of
correspondence&mdash;daily almost, it must have been&mdash;from Linton
Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were
embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious
love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with
touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more experienced
source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and
flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy
style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart. Whether
they satisfied Cathy I don&rsquo;t know; but they appeared very worthless trash
to me. After turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a
handkerchief and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.",0.0,0.0
Wuthering Heights,Emily Bronte,XXI,"Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the kitchen: I
watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little boy; and, while
the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into his jacket pocket, and
plucked something out. I went round by the garden, and laid wait for the
messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk
between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening
serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall
and perused Miss Cathy&rsquo;s affectionate composition. It was more simple and
more eloquent than her cousin&rsquo;s: very pretty and very silly. I shook my
head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet, she could not
divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her
morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer. Her father sat
reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some
unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her
proceedings. Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest, which it had
left brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair, in its

low-spirited&mdash;and that she invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse

high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots half exposed,
held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the latter; and strong winds
had blown some nearly horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb

considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but
so that she knew there was no necessity for descending. From dinner to tea she

sensitive, as it turns out. I&rsquo;ve got your letters, and if you give me any
pertness I&rsquo;ll send them to your father. I presume you grew weary of the
amusement and dropped it, didn&rsquo;t you? Well, you dropped Linton with it
into a Slough of Despond. He was in earnest: in love, really. As true as I
live, he&rsquo;s dying for you; breaking his heart at your fickleness: not
figuratively, but actually. Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six

was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past eight,
and then galloped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went: I was often
wretched all the time. Now and then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At
first, I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word
to Linton: for I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but,
as you stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael was
refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the
key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick,
and couldn&rsquo;t come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going:

thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him books

do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared
exceedingly good-natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little
rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and talked so merrily, and

manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank
of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among
the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright
sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That was his most perfect idea of
heaven&rsquo;s happiness: mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a
west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only
larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out
music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky
dells; but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the
breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with
joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and
dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he
said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he
could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish. At last, we agreed
to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each other

a game at blindman&rsquo;s-buff; she should try to catch us: you used to, you
know, Ellen. He wouldn&rsquo;t: there was no pleasure in it, he said; but he
consented to play at ball with me. We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of
old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and shuttlecocks. One was marked C.,
and the other H.; I wished to have the C., because that stood for Catherine,
and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and
Linton didn&rsquo;t like it. I beat him constantly: and he got cross again, and
coughed, and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his
good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs&mdash;<i>your</i>
songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come
the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying home as light as

will. I trotted up their garden, and was turning round to the back, when that
fellow Earnshaw met me, took my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.
He patted Minny&rsquo;s neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as

else it would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, &lsquo;It

not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before,
I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please you. To sneer at his
imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had you been brought up in his

character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and
though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused
them, and for her sake, you should also. You inquire after my health&mdash;it

might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at intervals, and
engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter; being well
aware of his hard position in his family. Linton complied; and had he been
unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with
complaints and lamentations: but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and,
of course, insisted on every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead
of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes
constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of
being held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr.
Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely
deceiving him with empty promises.",0.0,0.0

found him still declining. Though he had set aside yearly a portion of his
income for my young lady&rsquo;s fortune, he had a natural desire that she
might retain&mdash;or at least return in a short time to&mdash;the house of her
ancestors; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union
with his heir; he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as
himself; nor had any one, I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one
saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part,
began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually
rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so
earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father treating a dying
child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had
treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling the more

pettishness that might be caressed into fondness, had yielded to a listless
apathy; there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases
on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a
confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured
mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he

&ldquo;Do you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a
transformation on raising the lid&mdash;but I&rsquo;m better pleased that it
should not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct
impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly have
been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she died; and
eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit! I have a
strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and do, exist among
us! The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow. In the evening I went to
the churchyard. It blew bleak as winter&mdash;all round was solitary. I
didn&rsquo;t fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late;
and no one else had business to bring them there. Being alone, and conscious
two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us, I said to
myself&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have her in my arms again! If she be cold,
I&rsquo;ll think it is this north wind that chills <i>me</i>; and if she be
motionless, it is sleep.&rsquo; I got a spade from the tool-house, and began to
delve with all my might&mdash;it scraped the coffin; I fell to work with my
hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the point of
attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from some one above,
close at the edge of the grave, and bending down. &lsquo;If I can only get this
off,&rsquo; I muttered, &lsquo;I wish they may shovel in the earth over us
both!&rsquo; and I wrenched at it more desperately still. There was another
sigh, close at my ear. I appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the
sleet-laden wind. I knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as
certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark,
though it cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not
under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart
through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned consoled at
once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it remained while I
re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh, if you will; but I was
sure I should see her there. I was sure she was with me, and I could not help
talking to her. Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It
was fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my
entrance. I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying
upstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently&mdash;I felt her by
me&mdash;I could <i>almost</i> see her, and yet I <i>could not</i>! I ought to
have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning&mdash;from the fervour
of my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed herself,
as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then, sometimes more and
sometimes less, I&rsquo;ve been the sport of that intolerable torture!
Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that, if they had not resembled
catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of Linton&rsquo;s.
When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet
her; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from
home I hastened to return; she <i>must</i> be somewhere at the Heights, I was
certain! And when I slept in her chamber&mdash;I was beaten out of that. I
couldn&rsquo;t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either
outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room, or even
resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must
open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a
night&mdash;to be always disappointed! It racked me! I&rsquo;ve often groaned
aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was
playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I&rsquo;ve seen her, I&rsquo;m
pacified&mdash;a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by
fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through
eighteen years!&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since our separation.
Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my
coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was tired of seeing
Catherine: I must make the little parlour my sitting-room, and keep her with
me. It was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day. She seemed
pleased at this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of
books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and
flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not
last long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and
restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and it
fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on; for
another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her frequently, and she
complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen
to sitting at peace in her solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but
Hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to
have the house to himself! and though in the beginning she either left it at
his approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or
addressing him&mdash;and though he was always as sullen and silent as
possible&mdash;after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable

himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was at work to remedy

could not well do in the parlour, she would bring some pleasant volume and read
it aloud to me. When Hareton was there, she generally paused in an interesting
part, and left the book lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as
obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he
took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of

would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it. On

abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff. Catherine was
waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold her tongue, by asking
how she would like <i>him</i> to speak ill of her father? Then she comprehended
that Earnshaw took the master&rsquo;s reputation home to himself; and was
attached by ties stronger than reason could break&mdash;chains, forged by
habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart,
thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy
concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured

possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I came in to sit
with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed and comforted to
watch them, that I did not notice how time got on. You know, they both appeared
in a measure my children: I had long been proud of one; and now, I was sure,
the other would be a source of equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and
intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in
which it had been bred; and Catherine&rsquo;s sincere commendations acted as a
spur to his industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added
spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same
individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering
Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired and they laboured,
dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He came upon us quite
unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole
three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at him. Well, I reflected, there
was never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning shame
to scold them. The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed
their faces animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was
twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn,
that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted
maturity.",0.0,0.0

never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are those of
Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except
a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear
rather haughty, whether she will or not. With Hareton the resemblance is
carried farther: it is singular at all times, <i>then</i> it was particularly
striking; because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to
unwonted activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he
walked to the hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked
at the young man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there
yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then
returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her

train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything is
ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has
vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the precise time to
revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder
me. But where is the use? I don&rsquo;t care for striking: I can&rsquo;t take
the trouble to raise my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole
time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the

pain, amounting to agony. About <i>her</i> I won&rsquo;t speak; and I
don&rsquo;t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were invisible: her
presence invokes only maddening sensations. <i>He</i> moves me differently: and

making an effort to smile, &ldquo;if I try to describe the thousand forms of

you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination, is actually the

stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the slightest act not prompted by
one thought; and by compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead, which is
not associated with one universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole

complexion was clear and pale; her eyes I could not see, for, being bent upon
her prayer-book, they were concealed by their drooping lids and long black
lashes, but the brows above were expressive and well defined; the forehead was
lofty and intellectual, the nose, a perfect aquiline and the features, in
general, unexceptionable&mdash;only there was a slight hollowness about the
cheeks and eyes, and the lips, though finely formed, were a little too thin, a

well, acquired considerable elegance of manners, quite lost her provincial
accent, and could boast of more accomplishments than the vicar&rsquo;s
daughters. She was considered a beauty besides; but never for a moment could
she number me amongst her admirers. She was about six and twenty, rather tall

bright, light red; her complexion was remarkably fair and brilliant, her head
small, neck long, chin well turned, but very short, lips thin and red, eyes
clear hazel, quick, and penetrating, but entirely destitute of poetry or
feeling. She had, or might have had, many suitors in her own rank of life, but
scornfully repulsed or rejected them all; for none but a gentleman could please
her refined taste, and none but a rich one could satisfy her soaring ambition.

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,II,"I think the day I last mentioned was a certain Sunday, the latest in the
October of 1827. On the following Tuesday I was out with my dog and gun, in
pursuit of such game as I could find within the territory of Linden-Car; but
finding none at all, I turned my arms against the hawks and carrion crows,
whose depredations, as I suspected, had deprived me of better prey. To this end
I left the more frequented regions, the wooded valleys, the corn-fields, and
the meadow-lands, and proceeded to mount the steep acclivity of Wildfell, the
wildest and the loftiest eminence in our neighbourhood, where, as you ascend,
the hedges, as well as the trees, become scanty and stunted, the former, at
length, giving place to rough stone fences, partly greened over with ivy and
moss, the latter to larches and Scotch fir-trees, or isolated blackthorns. The
fields, being rough and stony, and wholly unfit for the plough, were mostly
devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle; the soil was thin and poor: bits
of grey rock here and there peeped out from the grassy hillocks;
bilberry-plants and heather&mdash;relics of more savage wildness&mdash;grew
under the walls; and in many of the enclosures, ragweeds and rushes usurped
supremacy over the scanty herbage; but these were not <i>my</i> property.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,II,"Near the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood Wildfell
Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of dark grey stone,
venerable and picturesque to look at, but doubtless, cold and gloomy enough to
inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and little latticed panes, its
time-eaten air-holes, and its too lonely, too unsheltered situation,&mdash;only
shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves
half blighted with storms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the Hall itself.
Behind it lay a few desolate fields, and then the brown heath-clad summit of
the hill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate, with
large balls of grey granite&mdash;similar to those which decorated the roof and
gables&mdash;surmounting the gate-posts) was a garden,&mdash;once stocked with
such hard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate, and such
trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener&rsquo;s torturing shears,
and most readily assume the shapes he chose to give them,&mdash;now, having
been left so many years untilled and untrimmed, abandoned to the weeds and the
grass, to the frost and the wind, the rain and the drought, it presented a very
singular appearance indeed. The close green walls of privet, that had bordered
the principal walk, were two-thirds withered away, and the rest grown beyond
all reasonable bounds; the old boxwood swan, that sat beside the scraper, had
lost its neck and half its body: the castellated towers of laurel in the middle
of the garden, the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway, and
the lion that guarded the other, were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as
resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in the waters under the earth;
but, to my young imagination, they presented all of them a goblinish
appearance, that harmonised well with the ghostly legions and dark traditions
our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed
occupants.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,II,"I had succeeded in killing a hawk and two crows when I came within sight of the

inhabitant. I did not like to go quite to the front and stare in at the gate;

and, glancing in the direction whence the sound proceeded, I beheld a tiny hand
elevated above the wall: it clung to the topmost stone, and then another little
hand was raised to take a firmer hold, and then appeared a small white

made no further advances. The child (a little boy, apparently about five years
old) scrambled up to the top of the wall, and called again and again; but
finding this of no avail, apparently made up his mind, like Mahomet, to go to
the mountain, since the mountain would not come to him, and attempted to get
over; but a crabbed old cherry-tree, that grew hard by, caught him by the frock

to disengage himself his foot slipped, and down he tumbled&mdash;but not to the

Essentially of reserved habits, and but seldom quitting the secluded place of

spirit of candour and frankness, when wholly unaccompanied with coarseness, he
admired in others, but he could not acquire it himself. His excessive reserve
upon all his own concerns was, indeed, provoking and chilly enough; but I
forgave it, from a conviction that it originated less in pride and want of
confidence in his friends, than in a certain morbid feeling of delicacy, and a
peculiar diffidence, that he was sensible of, but wanted energy to overcome.
His heart was like a sensitive plant, that opens for a moment in the sunshine,

entirely prohibited their children from tasting intoxicating liquors; but a
parent&rsquo;s authority cannot last for ever; children are naturally prone to
hanker after forbidden things; and a child, in such a case, would be likely to
have a strong curiosity to taste, and try the effect of what has been so lauded

circumstance did not greatly disconcert me, however, because I attributed it,
not so much to any dislike of my person, as to some absolute resolution against
a second marriage formed prior to the time of our acquaintance, whether from
excess of affection for her late husband, or because she had had enough of him

straight as Mr. Lawrence&rsquo;s; and the outline of his face, though not full

square, could never be drawn out to the long oval of the other&rsquo;s, while

Arthur by her side, and no one else. Why were they alone? Had the poison of
detracting tongues already spread through all; and had they all turned their
backs upon her? I now recollected having seen Mrs. Wilson, in the early part of
the evening, edging her chair close up to my mother, and bending forward,
evidently in the delivery of some important confidential intelligence; and from
the incessant wagging of her head, the frequent distortions of her wrinkled
physiognomy, and the winking and malicious twinkle of her little ugly eyes, I
judged it was some spicy piece of scandal that engaged her powers; and from the
cautious privacy of the communication I supposed some person then present was
the luckless object of her calumnies: and from all these tokens, together with
my mother&rsquo;s looks and gestures of mingled horror and incredulity, I now
concluded that object to have been Mrs. Graham. I did not emerge from my place

above twice a week; and still I made our meetings appear the result of accident
as often as I could&mdash;for I found it necessary to be extremely
careful&mdash;and, altogether, I behaved with such exceeding propriety that she
never had occasion to reprove me once. Yet I could not but perceive that she
was at times unhappy and dissatisfied with herself or her position, and truly I
myself was not quite contented with the latter: this assumption of brotherly
nonchalance was very hard to sustain, and I often felt myself a most confounded
hypocrite with it all; I saw too, or rather I felt, that, in spite of herself,

attention to the matter in hand, with very creditable determination, and
quickly concluded the bargain&mdash;perhaps more to the thrifty farmer&rsquo;s
satisfaction than he cared to acknowledge. Then, leaving him to the discussion

approached, I beheld, at no great distance, Mrs. Graham and her son coming down
in the opposite direction. They saw me; and Arthur already was running to meet
me; but I immediately turned back and walked steadily homeward; for I had fully
determined never to encounter his mother again; and regardless of the shrill
voice in my ear, calling upon me to &ldquo;wait a moment,&rdquo; I pursued the

salutation with a nod, attempted to push on; but he pushed on beside me, and

forgotten all former offences, but to be impenetrable to all present
incivilities. Formerly, the slightest hint, or mere fancied coldness in tone or
glance, had sufficed to repulse him: now, positive rudeness could not drive him
away. Had he heard of my disappointment; and was he come to witness the result,

overspread his face, and the few red drops that trickled down his forehead,

The pony, surprised to be so strangely relieved of its burden, started and
capered, and kicked a little, and then made use of its freedom to go and crop
the grass of the hedge-bank: while its master lay as still and silent as a

its pulsation, as I bent over him, gazing with breathless intensity upon the
ghastly, upturned face. But no; he moved his eyelids and uttered a slight

right&mdash;it would teach him better manners in future. Should I help him to
his horse? No. For any other combination of offences I would; but his were too

chance about it: if he told lies, I would contradict him; if he told the truth,

explanations further than I thought proper. Perhaps he might choose to be

indisposition;&mdash;I wonder what would have been the result if we had stayed
the full time. I am quite ashamed of my new-sprung distaste for country life.
All my former occupations seem so tedious and dull, my former amusements so
insipid and unprofitable. I cannot enjoy my music, because there is no one to
hear it. I cannot enjoy my walks, because there is no one to meet. I cannot
enjoy my books, because they have not power to arrest my attention: my head is
so haunted with the recollections of the last few weeks, that I cannot attend
to them. My drawing suits me best, for I can draw and think at the same time;
and if my productions cannot now be seen by any one but myself, and those who
do not care about them, they, possibly, may be, hereafter. But, then, there is
one face I am always trying to paint or to sketch, and always without success;

that his presence was disagreeable. Sullen silence was taken for rapt
attention, and gave him greater room to talk; sharp answers were received as

bewitching creature, but remember, the brightest attractions to the lover too

choice has not been made without much reasoning and reflection. The seeming
imprudence of the match has cost me many an anxious thought by day, and many a
sleepless hour by night; but at length I satisfied myself that it was not, in

these her youth, I trusted, was not one, but rather an earnest of virtues yet
unblown&mdash;a strong ground of presumption that her little defects of temper
and errors of judgment, opinion, or manner were not irremediable, but might
easily be removed or mitigated by the patient efforts of a watchful and
judicious adviser, and where I failed to enlighten and control, I thought I

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XVII,"The next day I accompanied my uncle and aunt to a dinner-party at Mr.
Wilmot&rsquo;s. He had two ladies staying with him: his niece Annabella, a fine
dashing girl, or rather young woman,&mdash;of some five-and-twenty, too great a
flirt to be married, according to her own assertion, but greatly admired by the
gentlemen, who universally pronounced her a splendid woman; and her gentle
cousin, Milicent Hargrave, who had taken a violent fancy to me, mistaking me
for something vastly better than I was. And I, in return, was very fond of her.
I should entirely exclude poor Milicent in my general animadversions against
the ladies of my acquaintance. But it was not on her account, or her
cousin&rsquo;s, that I have mentioned the party: it was for the sake of another
of Mr. Wilmot&rsquo;s guests, to wit Mr. Huntingdon. I have good reason to

a mixture of lurking ferocity and fulsome insincerity in his demeanour, that I
could not away with. What a tiresome custom that is, by-the-by&mdash;one among

might have chosen Miss Wilmot; for she seemed bent upon engrossing his
attention to herself, and he seemed nothing loth to pay the homage she
demanded. I thought so, at least, when I saw how they talked and laughed, and
glanced across the table, to the neglect and evident umbrage of their
respective neighbours&mdash;and afterwards, as the gentlemen joined us in the
drawing-room, when she, immediately upon his entrance, loudly called upon him
to be the arbiter of a dispute between herself and another lady, and he
answered the summons with alacrity, and decided the question without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation in her favour&mdash;though, to my thinking, she was
obviously in the wrong&mdash;and then stood chatting familiarly with her and a
group of other ladies; while I sat with Milicent Hargrave at the opposite end
of the room, looking over the latter&rsquo;s drawings, and aiding her with my
critical observations and advice, at her particular desire. But in spite of my
efforts to remain composed, my attention wandered from the drawings to the
merry group, and against my better judgment my wrath rose, and doubtless my
countenance lowered; for Milicent, observing that I must be tired of her daubs
and scratches, begged I would join the company now, and defer the examination
of the remainder to another opportunity. But while I was assuring her that I
had no wish to join them, and was not tired, Mr. Huntingdon himself came up to
the little round table at which we sat.",0.0,0.0

looking at, he drew a chair to my side, and receiving the drawings, one by one

said not a word about them, though he was talking all the time. I don&rsquo;t
know what Milicent Hargrave thought of such conduct, but <i>I</i> found his
conversation extremely interesting; though, as I afterwards discovered, when I
came to analyse it, it was chiefly confined to quizzing the different members
of the company present; and albeit he made some clever remarks, and some
excessively droll ones, I do not think the whole would appear anything very
particular, if written here, without the adventitious aids of look, and tone,
and gesture, and that ineffable but indefinite charm, which cast a halo over
all he did and said, and which would have made it a delight to look in his
face, and hear the music of his voice, if he had been talking positive
nonsense&mdash;and which, moreover, made me feel so bitter against my aunt when
she put a stop to this enjoyment, by coming composedly forward, under pretence
of wishing to see the drawings, that she cared and knew nothing about, and
while making believe to examine them, addressing herself to Mr. Huntingdon,
with one of her coldest and most repellent aspects, and beginning a series of
the most common-place and formidably formal questions and observations, on
purpose to wrest his attention from me&mdash;on purpose to vex me, as I
thought: and having now looked through the portfolio, I left them to their
<i>tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte</i>, and seated myself on a sofa, quite apart from the
company&mdash;never thinking how strange such conduct would appear, but merely
to indulge, at first, the vexation of the moment, and subsequently to enjoy my
private thoughts.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XVII,"But I was not left long alone, for Mr. Wilmot, of all men the least welcome,
took advantage of my isolated position to come and plant himself beside me. I
had flattered myself that I had so effectually repulsed his advances on all
former occasions, that I had nothing more to apprehend from his unfortunate
predilection; but it seems I was mistaken: so great was his confidence, either
in his wealth or his remaining powers of attraction, and so firm his conviction
of feminine weakness, that he thought himself warranted to return to the siege,
which he did with renovated ardour, enkindled by the quantity of wine he had
drunk&mdash;a circumstance that rendered him infinitely the more disgusting;
but greatly as I abhorred him at that moment, I did not like to treat him with
rudeness, as I was now his guest, and had just been enjoying his hospitality;
and I was no hand at a polite but determined rejection, nor would it have
greatly availed me if I had, for he was too coarse-minded to take any repulse
that was not as plain and positive as his own effrontery. The consequence was,
that he waxed more fulsomely tender, and more repulsively warm, and I was
driven to the very verge of desperation, and about to say I know not what, when
I felt my hand, that hung over the arm of the sofa, suddenly taken by another
and gently but fervently pressed. Instinctively, I guessed who it was, and, on
looking up, was less surprised than delighted to see Mr. Huntingdon smiling
upon me. It was like turning from some purgatorial fiend to an angel of light,

he still retained within his arm, he interrupted me with,&mdash;&ldquo;Never

still looking forward to spring with the hope of returning to town, not for its
gaieties and dissipations, but for the chance of meeting Mr. Huntingdon once
again; for still he is always in my thoughts and in my dreams. In all my
employments, whatever I do, or see, or hear, has an ultimate reference to him;
whatever skill or knowledge I acquire is some day to be turned to his advantage
or amusement; whatever new beauties in nature or art I discover are to be
depicted to meet his eye, or stored in my memory to be told him at some future
period. This, at least, is the hope that I cherish, the fancy that lights me on
my lonely way. It may be only an ignis fatuus, after all, but it can do no harm
to follow it with my eyes and rejoice in its lustre, as long as it does not
lure me from the path I ought to keep; and I think it will not, for I have

spare the partridges till the gentlemen come. &ldquo;What gentlemen?&rdquo; I
asked when I heard it. A small party he had invited to shoot. His friend Mr.

me as terrible news at the moment; but all regret and apprehension vanished

it was no use talking, for the mischief was already done: he had invited
Huntingdon and his friend Lord Lowborough before we left London, and nothing

got into her room, I quitted my post a few minutes to look in upon her and have
a little private conversation, for she was now my intimate friend, several long

I beheld another carriage at the door. Was it his? No; it was Mr.
Boarham&rsquo;s plain dark chariot; and there stood he upon the steps,
carefully superintending the dislodging of his various boxes and packages. What
a collection! One would have thought he projected a visit of six months at
least. A considerable time after, came Lord Lowborough in his barouche. Is he
one of the profligate friends, I wonder? I should think not; for no one could
call <i>him</i> a jolly companion, I&rsquo;m sure,&mdash;and, besides, he

unfortunate exception, I had carefully obliterated all such witnesses of my

Every one attended the morning service, except my uncle, who hardly ever goes,

In the afternoon Miss Wilmot and Lord Lowborough likewise excused themselves
from attending; but Mr. Huntingdon vouchsafed to accompany us again. Whether it
was to ingratiate himself with my aunt I cannot tell, but, if so, he certainly
should have behaved better. I must confess, I did not like his conduct during
service at all. Holding his prayer-book upside down, or open at any place but
the right, he did nothing but stare about him, unless he happened to catch my
aunt&rsquo;s eye or mine, and then he would drop his own on his book, with a
puritanical air of mock solemnity that would have been ludicrous, if it had not
been too provoking. Once, during the sermon, after attentively regarding Mr.
Leighton for a few minutes, he suddenly produced his gold pencil-case and
snatched up a Bible. Perceiving that I observed the movement, he whispered that
he was going to make a note of the sermon; but instead of that, as I sat next
him, I could not help seeing that he was making a caricature of the preacher,
giving to the respectable, pious, elderly gentleman, the air and aspect of a
most absurd old hypocrite. And yet, upon his return, he talked to my aunt about

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXII,"&ldquo;No, not he. That was the first attraction, certainly; but now he has
quite lost sight of it: it never enters his calculations, except merely as an
essential without which, for the lady&rsquo;s own sake, he could not think of
marrying her. No; he&rsquo;s fairly in love. He thought he never could be
again, but he&rsquo;s in for it once more. He was to have been married before,
some two or three years ago; but he lost his bride by losing his fortune. He
got into a bad way among us in London: he had an unfortunate taste for
gambling; and surely the fellow was born under an unlucky star, for he always
lost thrice where he gained once. That&rsquo;s a mode of self-torment I never
was much addicted to. When I spend my money I like to enjoy the full value of
it: I see no fun in wasting it on thieves and blacklegs; and as for
<i>gaining</i> money, hitherto I have always had sufficient; it&rsquo;s time
enough to be clutching for more, I think, when you begin to see the end of what
you have. But I have sometimes frequented the gaming-houses just to watch the
on-goings of those mad votaries of chance&mdash;a very interesting study, I
assure you, Helen, and sometimes very diverting: I&rsquo;ve had many a laugh at
the boobies and bedlamites. Lowborough was quite infatuated&mdash;not
willingly, but of necessity,&mdash;he was always resolving to give it up, and
always breaking his resolutions. Every venture was the &ldquo;just once
more:&rdquo; if he gained a little, he hoped to gain a little more next time,
and if he lost, it would not do to leave off at that juncture; he must go on
till he had retrieved that last misfortune, at least: bad luck could not last
for ever; and every lucky hit was looked upon as the dawn of better times, till
experience proved the contrary. At length he grew desperate, and we were daily
on the look-out for a case of <i>felo-de-se</i>&mdash;no great matter, some of
us whispered, as his existence had ceased to be an acquisition to our club. At
last, however, he came to a check. He made a large stake, which he determined

to be sure, and as often broken his determination; and so it was this time. He
lost; and while his antagonist smilingly swept away the stakes, he turned

unspeakable curses on his head if ever he should shuffle a card or rattle a

present to play against him. Grimsby instantly presented himself. Lowborough
glared fiercely at him, for Grimsby was almost as celebrated for his luck as

were most of us assembled together again, he entered, silent and grim as a
ghost, and would have quietly slipped into his usual seat at my elbow, but we
all rose to welcome him, and several voices were raised to ask what he would
have, and several hands were busy with bottle and glass to serve him; but I

in his chair; so we let him be. But I left the glass by him; and, after awhile,
Grimsby directed my attention towards it, by a significant wink; and, on
turning my head, I saw it was drained to the bottom. He made me a sign to
replenish, and quietly pushed up the bottle. I willingly complied; but
Lowborough detected the pantomime, and, nettled at the intelligent grins that
were passing between us, snatched the glass from my hand, dashed the contents

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXII,"&ldquo;After that,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Lowborough kept aloof from us a
week or two longer. I used to meet him occasionally in the town; and then, as I
was too good-natured to resent his unmannerly conduct, and he bore no malice
against me,&mdash;he was never unwilling to talk to me; on the contrary, he
would cling to me, and follow me anywhere but to the club, and the
gaming-houses, and such-like dangerous places of resort&mdash;he was so weary
of his own moping, melancholy mind. At last, I got him to come in with me to
the club, on condition that I would not tempt him to drink; and, for some time,
he continued to look in upon us pretty regularly of an evening,&mdash;still
abstaining, with wonderful perseverance, from the &lsquo;rank poison&rsquo; he
had so bravely forsworn. But some of our members protested against this
conduct. They did not like to have him sitting there like a skeleton at a
feast, instead of contributing his quota to the general amusement, casting a
cloud over all, and watching, with greedy eyes, every drop they carried to
their lips&mdash;they vowed it was not fair; and some of them maintained that
he should either be compelled to do as others did, or expelled from the
society; and swore that, next time he showed himself, they would tell him as
much, and, if he did not take the warning, proceed to active measures. However,
I befriended him on this occasion, and recommended them to let him be for a
while, intimating that, with a little patience on our parts, he would soon come
round again. But, to be sure, it <i>was</i> rather provoking; for, though he
refused to drink like an honest Christian, it was well known to me that he kept
a private bottle of laudanum about him, which he was continually soaking
at&mdash;or rather, holding off and on with, abstaining one day and exceeding
the next&mdash;just like the spirits.",0.0,0.0

and seated himself, as usual, a little back from the table, in the chair we
always placed for &lsquo;the spectre,&rsquo; whether it chose to fill it or
not. I saw by his face that he was suffering from the effects of an overdose of
his insidious comforter; but nobody spoke to him, and he spoke to nobody. A few
sidelong glances, and a whispered observation, that &lsquo;the ghost was
come,&rsquo; was all the notice he drew by his appearance, and we went on with
our merry carousals as before, till he startled us all by suddenly drawing in

he recklessly added, and thus continued his relation: &ldquo;In his desperate

was sufficiently re-established, to embrace the media-via,
ni-jamais-ni-toujours plan&mdash;not to kill himself like a fool, and not to
abstain like a ninny&mdash;in a word, to enjoy himself like a rational
creature, and do as I did; for, don&rsquo;t think, Helen, that I&rsquo;m a
tippler; I&rsquo;m nothing at all of the kind, and never was, and never shall
be. I value my comfort far too much. I see that a man cannot give himself up to
drinking without being miserable one-half his days and mad the other; besides,
I like to enjoy my life at all sides and ends, which cannot be done by one that
suffers himself to be the slave of a single propensity&mdash;and, moreover,

a model of moderation and prudence&mdash;something too much so for the tastes
of our wild community; but, somehow, Lowborough had not the gift of moderation:
if he stumbled a little to one side, he must go down before he could right
himself: if he overshot the mark one night, the effects of it rendered him so
miserable the next day that he must repeat the offence to mend it; and so on
from day to day, till his clamorous conscience brought him to a stand. And
then, in his sober moments, he so bothered his friends with his remorse, and
his terrors and woes, that they were obliged, in self-defence, to get him to
drown his sorrows in wine, or any more potent beverage that came to hand; and
when his first scruples of conscience were overcome, he would need no more
persuading, he would often grow desperate, and be as great a blackguard as any
of them could desire&mdash;but only to lament his own unutterable wickedness
and degradation the more when the fit was over.",0.0,0.0

draw me from the perdition he considered himself to have escaped; but when I
did happen to meet him, I seldom failed to ask after the progress of his
matrimonial efforts and researches, and, in general, he could give me but a

did not dare to fix his hopes on one so courted and admired, till after they
were brought into closer contact here at Staningley, and she, in the absence of
her other admirers, indubitably courted his notice and held out every
encouragement to his timid advances. Then, indeed, he began to hope for a dawn
of brighter days; and if, for a while, I darkened his prospects by standing
between him and his sun&mdash;and so nearly plunged him again into the abyss of
despair&mdash;it only intensified his ardour and strengthened his hopes when I
chose to abandon the field in the pursuit of a brighter treasure. In a word, as
I told you, he is fairly besotted. At first, he could dimly perceive her

struggle in my face, and misconstrues my bitterness of soul for his
unworthiness into the pangs of wounded jealousy; and when he has sufficiently

both when the letter-bag was brought in. It contained upon examination a
newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a couple of letters for me, which
he tossed across the table without a remark. One was from my brother, the other
from Milicent Hargrave, who is now in London with her mother. His, I think,
were business letters, and apparently not much to his mind, for he crushed them
into his pocket with some muttered expletives that I should have reproved him
for at any other time. The paper he set before him, and pretended to be deeply
absorbed in its contents during the remainder of breakfast, and a considerable
time after.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXIV,"The reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of household
concerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning: after lunch I got my
drawing, and from dinner till bed-time I read. Meanwhile, poor Arthur was sadly
at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy his time. He wanted to appear
as busy and as unconcerned as I did. Had the weather at all permitted, he would
doubtless have ordered his horse and set off to some distant region, no matter
where, immediately after breakfast, and not returned till night: had there been
a lady anywhere within reach, of any age between fifteen and forty-five, he
would have sought revenge and found employment in getting up, or trying to get
up, a desperate flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction,
entirely cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings were
truly deplorable. When he had done yawning over his paper and scribbling short
answers to his shorter letters, he spent the remainder of the morning and the
whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from room to room, watching the
clouds, cursing the rain, alternately petting and teasing and abusing his dogs,
sometimes lounging on the sofa with a book that he could not force himself to
read, and very often fixedly gazing at me when he thought I did not perceive
it, with the vain hope of detecting some traces of tears, or some tokens of
remorseful anguish in my face. But I managed to preserve an undisturbed though
grave serenity throughout the day. I was not really angry: I felt for him all
the time, and longed to be reconciled; but I determined he should make the
first advances, or at least show some signs of an humble and contrite spirit
first; for, if I began, it would only minister to his self-conceit, increase
his arrogance, and quite destroy the lesson I wanted to give him.",0.0,1.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXIV,"He made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear, took an
unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his tongue: for when he came
in and found me quietly occupied with my book, too busy to lift my head on his
entrance, he merely murmured an expression of suppressed disapprobation, and,
shutting the door with a bang, went and stretched himself at full length on the
sofa, and composed himself to sleep. But his favourite cocker, Dash, that had
been lying at my feet, took the liberty of jumping upon him and beginning to
lick his face. He struck it off with a smart blow, and the poor dog squeaked
and ran cowering back to me. When he woke up, about half an hour after, he
called it to him again, but Dash only looked sheepish and wagged the tip of his
tail. He called again more sharply, but Dash only clung the closer to me, and
licked my hand, as if imploring protection. Enraged at this, his master
snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head. The poor dog set up a
piteous outcry, and ran to the door. I let him out, and then quietly took up

short space of time, I was quite tired out. He seemed bent upon displaying me
to his friends and acquaintances in particular, and the public in general, on
every possible occasion, and to the greatest possible advantage. It was
something to feel that he considered me a worthy object of pride; but I paid
dear for the gratification: for, in the first place, to please him I had to
violate my cherished predilections, my almost rooted principles in favour of a
plain, dark, sober style of dress&mdash;I must sparkle in costly jewels and
deck myself out like a painted butterfly, just as I had, long since, determined
I would never do&mdash;and this was no trifling sacrifice; in the second place,

him by some awkward misdemeanour, or some trait of inexperienced ignorance

intimated before, I was wearied of the throng and bustle, the restless hurry

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXV,"&ldquo;I hardly know what to say about it,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;or what to
think. To tell you the truth, Helen, I don&rsquo;t like the thoughts of it at
all. If I <i>am</i> to be Mr. Hattersley&rsquo;s wife, I must try to love him;
and I do try with all my might; but I have made very little progress yet; and
the worst symptom of the case is, that the further he is from me the better I
like him: he frightens me with his abrupt manners and strange hectoring ways,
and I dread the thoughts of marrying him. &lsquo;Then why have you accepted
him?&rsquo; you will ask; and I didn&rsquo;t know I had accepted him; but mamma
tells me I have, and he seems to think so too. I certainly didn&rsquo;t mean to
do so; but I did not like to give him a flat refusal, for fear mamma should be
grieved and angry (for I knew she wished me to marry him), and I wanted to talk
to her first about it: so I gave him what <i>I</i> thought was an evasive, half
negative answer; but she says it was as good as an acceptance, and he would
think me very capricious if I were to attempt to draw back&mdash;and indeed I
was so confused and frightened at the moment, I can hardly tell what I said.
And next time I saw him, he accosted me in all confidence as his affianced
bride, and immediately began to settle matters with mamma. I had not courage to
contradict them then, and how can I do it now? I cannot; they would think me
mad. Besides, mamma is so delighted with the idea of the match; she thinks she
has managed so well for me; and I cannot bear to disappoint her. I do object
sometimes, and tell her what I feel, but you don&rsquo;t know <i>how</i> she
talks. Mr. Hattersley, you know, is the son of a rich banker, and as Esther and
I have no fortunes, and Walter very little, our dear mamma is very anxious to
see us all well married, that is, united to rich partners. It is not <i>my</i>
idea of being well married, but she means it all for the best. She says when I
am safe off her hands it will be such a relief to her mind; and she assures me
it will be a good thing for the family as well as for me. Even Walter is
pleased at the prospect, and when I confessed my reluctance to him, he said it
was all childish nonsense. Do <i>you</i> think it nonsense, Helen? I should not
care if I could see any prospect of being able to love and admire him, but I
can&rsquo;t. There is nothing about him to hang one&rsquo;s esteem and
affection upon; he is so diametrically opposite to what I imagined my husband
should be. Do write to me, and say all you can to encourage me. Don&rsquo;t
attempt to dissuade me, for my fate is fixed: preparations for the important

summer is passing away without one breath of pleasure to me or benefit to him.
And I had all along been looking forward to this season with the fond, delusive
hope that we should enjoy it so sweetly together; and that, with God&rsquo;s
help and my exertions, it would be the means of elevating his mind, and
refining his taste to a due appreciation of the salutary and pure delights of
nature, and peace, and holy love. But now&mdash;at evening, when I see the
round red sun sink quietly down behind those woody hills, leaving them sleeping
in a warm, red, golden haze, I only think another lovely day is lost to him and

the gleeful twitter of the swallows&mdash;all intent upon feeding their young,
and full of life and joy in their own little frames&mdash;I open the window to
inhale the balmy, soul-reviving air, and look out upon the lovely landscape,
laughing in dew and sunshine&mdash;I too often shame that glorious scene with
tears of thankless misery, because <i>he</i> cannot feel its freshening

flowers smiling in my path, or sit in the shadow of our noble ash-trees by the
water-side, with their branches gently swaying in the light summer breeze that
murmurs through their feathery foliage&mdash;my ears full of that low music
mingled with the dreamy hum of insects, my eyes abstractedly gazing on the
glassy surface of the little lake before me, with the trees that crowd about
its bank, some gracefully bending to kiss its waters, some rearing their
stately heads high above, but stretching their wide arms over its margin, all
faithfully mirrored far, far down in its glassy depth&mdash;though sometimes
the images are partially broken by the sport of aquatic insects, and sometimes,
for a moment, the whole is shivered into trembling fragments by a transient
breeze that sweeps the surface too roughly&mdash;still I have no pleasure; for
the greater the happiness that nature sets before me, the more I lament that
<i>he</i> is not here to taste it: the greater the bliss we might enjoy
together, the more I feel our present wretchedness apart (yes, ours; he must be
wretched, though he may not know it); and the more my senses are pleased, the

in her husband, some of which, I fear, less partial eyes would fail to
distinguish, though they sought them carefully with tears; and now that she is
accustomed to his loud voice, and abrupt, uncourteous manners, she affirms she
finds no difficulty in loving him as a wife should do, and begs I will burn
that letter wherein she spoke so unadvisedly against him. So that I trust she
may yet be happy; but, if she is, it will be entirely the reward of her own
goodness of heart; for had she chosen to consider herself the victim of fate,
or of her mother&rsquo;s worldly wisdom, she might have been thoroughly

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXVI,"Sept. 23rd.&mdash;Our guests arrived about three weeks ago. Lord and Lady
Lowborough have now been married above eight months; and I will do the lady the
credit to say that her husband is quite an altered man; his looks, his spirits,
and his temper, are all perceptibly changed for the better since I last saw
him. But there is room for improvement still. He is not always cheerful, nor
always contented, and she often complains of his ill-humour, which, however, of
all persons, <i>she</i> ought to be the last to accuse him of, as he never
displays it against her, except for such conduct as would provoke a saint. He
adores her still, and would go to the world&rsquo;s end to please her. She
knows her power, and she uses it too; but well knowing that to wheedle and coax
is safer than to command, she judiciously tempers her despotism with flattery
and blandishments enough to make him deem himself a favoured and a happy man.",0.0,0.0

be, if I chose to regard myself as such. This is by openly, but not too
glaringly, coquetting with Mr. Huntingdon, who is quite willing to be her
partner in the game; but I don&rsquo;t care for it, because, with him, I know
there is nothing but personal vanity, and a mischievous desire to excite my
jealousy, and, perhaps, to torment his friend; and she, no doubt, is actuated
by much the same motives; only, there is more of malice and less of playfulness
in <i>her</i> manÅuvres. It is obviously, therefore, my interest to disappoint
them both, as far as I am concerned, by preserving a cheerful, undisturbed
serenity throughout; and, accordingly, I endeavour to show the fullest
confidence in my husband, and the greatest indifference to the arts of my
attractive guest. I have never reproached the former but once, and that was for
laughing at Lord Lowborough&rsquo;s depressed and anxious countenance one
evening, when they had both been particularly provoking; and then, indeed, I
said a good deal on the subject, and rebuked him sternly enough; but he only

left Lord Lowborough to take care of himself. He either has not the sense or
the power to follow my example, though he does try to conceal his uneasiness as
well as he can; but still, it will appear in his face, and his ill-humour will
peep out at intervals, though not in the expression of open
resentment&mdash;they never go far enough for that. But I confess I do feel
jealous at times, most painfully, bitterly so; when she sings and plays to him,
and he hangs over the instrument, and dwells upon her voice with no affected
interest; for then I know he is really delighted, and I have no power to awaken
similar fervour. I can amuse and please him with my simple songs, but not

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXVI,"28th.&mdash;Yesterday, we all went to the Grove, Mr. Hargrave&rsquo;s
much-neglected home. His mother frequently asks us over, that she may have the
pleasure of her dear Walter&rsquo;s company; and this time she had invited us
to a dinner-party, and got together as many of the country gentry as were
within reach to meet us. The entertainment was very well got up; but I could
not help thinking about the cost of it all the time. I don&rsquo;t like Mrs.
Hargrave; she is a hard, pretentious, worldly-minded woman. She has money
enough to live very comfortably, if she only knew how to use it judiciously,
and had taught her son to do the same; but she is ever straining to keep up
appearances, with that despicable pride that shuns the semblance of poverty as
of a shameful crime. She grinds her dependents, pinches her servants, and
deprives even her daughters and herself of the real comforts of life, because
she will not consent to yield the palm in outward show to those who have three
times her wealth; and, above all, because she is determined her cherished son
shall be enabled to &ldquo;hold up his head with the highest gentlemen in the
land.&rdquo; This same son, I imagine, is a man of expensive habits, no
reckless spendthrift and no abandoned sensualist, but one who likes to have
&ldquo;everything handsome about him,&rdquo; and to go to a certain length in
youthful indulgences, not so much to gratify his own tastes as to maintain his
reputation as a man of fashion in the world, and a respectable fellow among his
own lawless companions; while he is too selfish to consider how many comforts
might be obtained for his fond mother and sisters with the money he thus wastes
upon himself: as long as they can contrive to make a respectable appearance
once a year, when they come to town, he gives himself little concern about
their private stintings and struggles at home. This is a harsh judgment to form
of &ldquo;dear, noble-minded, generous-hearted Walter,&rdquo; but I fear it is
too just.",0.0,0.0

discharged her maternal duty, and hopes to do as well for Esther. But Esther is

her hand quietly surrendered to his clasp. The blood rushed first to my heart,

approach, he cast a hurried glance over his shoulder towards the other
occupants of the room, and then ardently pressed the unresisting hand to his

Lowborough is manifestly more cheerful, and more cordial towards his host than

Annabella that it is quite a task to be civil to her, and as she is the only

could not. His injustice and ill-humour towards his inferiors, who could not

object, as was frequently the case, I endured it with calm forbearance, except
at times, when my temper, worn out by repeated annoyances, or stung to
distraction by some new instance of irrationality, gave way in spite of myself,
and exposed me to the imputations of fierceness, cruelty, and impatience. I
attended carefully to his wants and amusements, but not, I own, with the same
devoted fondness as before, because I could not feel it; besides, I had now
another claimant on my time and care&mdash;my ailing infant, for whose sake I
frequently braved and suffered the reproaches and complaints of his
unreasonably exacting father.",0.0,1.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXX,"But Arthur is not naturally a peevish or irritable man; so far from it, that
there was something almost ludicrous in the incongruity of this adventitious
fretfulness and nervous irritability, rather calculated to excite laughter than
anger, if it were not for the intensely painful considerations attendant upon
those symptoms of a disordered frame, and his temper gradually improved as his
bodily health was restored, which was much sooner than would have been the case
but for my strenuous exertions; for there was still one thing about him that I
did not give up in despair, and one effort for his preservation that I would
not remit. His appetite for the stimulus of wine had increased upon him, as I
had too well foreseen. It was now something more to him than an accessory to
social enjoyment: it was an important source of enjoyment in itself. In this
time of weakness and depression he would have made it his medicine and support,
his comforter, his recreation, and his friend, and thereby sunk deeper and
deeper, and bound himself down for ever in the bathos whereinto he had fallen.
But I determined this should never be, as long as I had any influence left; and
though I could not prevent him from taking more than was good for him, still,
by incessant perseverance, by kindness, and firmness, and vigilance, by
coaxing, and daring, and determination, I succeeded in preserving him from
absolute bondage to that detestable propensity, so insidious in its advances,
so inexorable in its tyranny, so disastrous in its effects.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXX,"And here I must not forget that I am not a little indebted to his friend Mr.
Hargrave. About that time he frequently called at Grassdale, and often dined
with us, on which occasions I fear Arthur would willingly have cast prudence
and decorum to the winds, and made &ldquo;a night of it,&rdquo; as often as his
friend would have consented to join him in that exalted pastime; and if the
latter had chosen to comply, he might, in a night or two, have ruined the
labour of weeks, and overthrown with a touch the frail bulwark it had cost me
such trouble and toil to construct. I was so fearful of this at first, that I
humbled myself to intimate to him, in private, my apprehensions of
Arthur&rsquo;s proneness to these excesses, and to express a hope that he would
not encourage it. He was pleased with this mark of confidence, and certainly
did not betray it. On that and every subsequent occasion his presence served
rather as a check upon his host, than an incitement to further acts of
intemperance; and he always succeeded in bringing him from the dining-room in
good time, and in tolerably good condition; for if Arthur disregarded such
intimations as &ldquo;Well, I must not detain you from your lady,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;We must not forget that Mrs. Huntingdon is alone,&rdquo; he would insist
upon leaving the table himself, to join me, and his host, however unwillingly,
was obliged to follow.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XXX,"Hence I learned to welcome Mr. Hargrave as a real friend to the family, a
harmless companion for Arthur, to cheer his spirits and preserve him from the
tedium of absolute idleness and a total isolation from all society but mine,
and a useful ally to me. I could not but feel grateful to him under such
circumstances; and I did not scruple to acknowledge my obligation on the first
convenient opportunity; yet, as I did so, my heart whispered all was not right,
and brought a glow to my face, which he heightened by his steady, serious gaze,
while, by his manner of receiving those acknowledgments, he more than doubled
my misgivings. His high delight at being able to serve me was chastened by
sympathy for me and commiseration for himself&mdash;about, I know not what, for
I would not stay to inquire, or suffer him to unburden his sorrows to me. His
sighs and intimations of suppressed affliction seemed to come from a full
heart; but either he must contrive to retain them within it, or breathe them
forth in other ears than mine: there was enough of confidence between us
already. It seemed wrong that there should exist a secret understanding between
my husband&rsquo;s friend and me, unknown to him, of which he was the object.

fault, not mine.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

own: I blush for him, I fear for him; I repent for him, weep, pray, and feel
for him as for myself; but I cannot act for him; and hence I must be, and I am,
debased, contaminated by the union, both in my own eyes and in the actual

errors, that I am continually dwelling upon them, and labouring to extenuate

losing that instinctive horror and repulsion which were given me by nature, or
instilled into me by the precepts and example of my aunt. Perhaps then I was
too severe in my judgments, for I abhorred the sinner as well as the sin; now I
flatter myself I am more charitable and considerate; but am I not becoming more
indifferent and insensate too? Fool that I was, to dream that I had strength
and purity enough to save myself and him! Such vain presumption would be
rightly served, if I should perish with him in the gulf from which I sought to
save him! Yet, God preserve me from it, and him too! Yes, poor Arthur, I will

though neither long nor loverlike, were more regular than ever they had been
before; and when he did return, to my great joy, instead of being worse than
when he went, he was more cheerful and vigorous, and better in every respect.
Since that time I have had little cause to complain. He still has an
unfortunate predilection for the pleasures of the table, against which I have
to struggle and watch; but he has begun to notice his boy, and that is an
increasing source of amusement to him within-doors, while his fox-hunting and
coursing are a sufficient occupation for him without, when the ground is not
hardened by frost; so that he is not wholly dependent on me for entertainment.

his injustice, his selfishness and hopeless <i>depravity</i>. I wish a milder
word would do; I am no angel, and my corruption rises against it. My poor
father died last week: Arthur was vexed to hear of it, because he saw that I
was shocked and grieved, and he feared the circumstance would mar his comfort.

duty to compose your face and manners into conformity with your funereal garb.
Why should you sigh and groan, and I be made uncomfortable, because an old
gentleman in &mdash;&mdash;shire, a perfect stranger to us both, has thought
proper to drink himself to death? There, now, I declare you&rsquo;re crying!

my mouth, I regretted having uttered them. It seemed so heavy a charge: if
false, too gross an insult; if true, too humiliating a fact to be thus openly
cast in his teeth. But I might have spared myself that momentary pang of
self-reproach. The accusation awoke neither shame nor indignation in him: he
attempted neither denial nor excuse, but only answered with a long, low,
chuckling laugh, as if he viewed the whole transaction as a clever, merry jest

dislike to Lady Lowborough. It is not founded on mere personal pique; it is the
woman herself that I dislike, because I so thoroughly disapprove of her. I
always avoid her company as much as I can without violating the laws of
hospitality; but when we do speak or converse together, it is with the utmost
civility, even apparent cordiality on her part; but preserve me from such
cordiality! It is like handling brier-roses and may-blossoms, bright enough to
the eye, and outwardly soft to the touch, but you know there are thorns

injury by crushing them in till you have destroyed their power, though somewhat

smiling to himself at her artful manÅuvres: but, to his praise be it spoken,
her shafts fell powerless by his side. Her most bewitching smiles, her
haughtiest frowns were ever received with the same immutable, careless
good-humour; till, finding he was indeed impenetrable, she suddenly remitted

leaving Annabella and the rest to follow when they pleased, I withdrew, but not

lighted for his accommodation; or, on fine moonlight nights, in roaming about

it since, and of late she has comported herself with wonderful propriety

husband, her brother, and her over-estimated friend acquitting themselves so
well, was lively and gay too, in her quiet way. Even Lord Lowborough caught the
general contagion: his dark greenish eyes were lighted up beneath their moody
brows; his sombre countenance was beautified by smiles; all traces of gloom and
proud or cold reserve had vanished for the time; and he astonished us all, not
only by his general cheerfulness and animation, but by the positive flashes of

God, but could not frame its anguish into prayer; until a gust of wind swept
over me, which, while it scattered the dead leaves, like blighted hopes,
around, cooled my forehead, and seemed a little to revive my sinking frame.
Then, while I lifted up my soul in speechless, earnest supplication, some
heavenly influence seemed to strengthen me within: I breathed more freely; my
vision cleared; I saw distinctly the pure moon shining on, and the light clouds
skimming the clear, dark sky; and then I saw the eternal stars twinkling down
upon me; I knew their God was mine, and He was strong to save and swift to
hear. &ldquo;I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,&rdquo; seemed whispered

affectionate familiarity in my presence, when no one else is by, and is
particularly fond of displaying her interest in his health and welfare, or in
anything that concerns him, as if for the purpose of contrasting her kind
solicitude with my cold indifference. And he rewards her by such smiles and
glances, such whispered words, or boldly-spoken insinuations, indicative of his
sense of her goodness and my neglect, as make the blood rush into my face, in
spite of myself&mdash;for I would be utterly regardless of it all&mdash;deaf
and blind to everything that passes between them, since the more I show myself
sensible of their wickedness the more she triumphs in her victory, and the more
he flatters himself that I love him devotedly still, in spite of my pretended
indifference. On such occasions I have sometimes been startled by a subtle,
fiendish suggestion inciting me to show him the contrary by a seeming
encouragement of Hargrave&rsquo;s advances; but such ideas are banished in a
moment with horror and self-abasement; and then I hate him tenfold more than
ever for having brought me to this!&mdash;God pardon me for it and all my
sinful thoughts! Instead of being humbled and purified by my afflictions, I

without a friend to guide him through its weary mazes, to warn him of its
thousand snares, and guard him from the perils that beset him on every hand. I
am not well fitted to be his only companion, I know; but there is no other to
supply my place. I am too grave to minister to his amusements and enter into
his infantile sports as a nurse or a mother ought to do, and often his bursts
of gleeful merriment trouble and alarm me; I see in them his father&rsquo;s
spirit and temperament, and I tremble for the consequences; and too often damp
the innocent mirth I ought to share. That father, on the contrary, has no
weight of sadness on his mind; is troubled with no fears, no scruples

the child dotes upon his seemingly joyous amusing, ever-indulgent papa, and

not so much for the sake of my son&rsquo;s affection (though I do prize that
highly, and though I feel it is my right, and know I have done much to earn it)

purchase and retain, and which for very spite his father delights to rob me of,
and, from motives of mere idle egotism, is pleased to win to himself; making no
use of it but to torment me and ruin the child. My only consolation is, that he
spends comparatively little of his time at home, and, during the months he
passes in London or elsewhere, I have a chance of recovering the ground I had
lost, and overcoming with good the evil he has wrought by his wilful
mismanagement. But then it is a bitter trial to behold him, on his return,

certain prudent restrictions (which I deemed scarcely necessary); when,
presuming upon my unsuspecting kindness, he thought he might venture to
overstep the bounds of decent moderation and propriety that had so long
restrained him. It was on a pleasant evening at the close of May: I was
wandering in the park, and he, on seeing me there as he rode past, made bold to
enter and approach me, dismounting and leaving his horse at the gate. This was
the first time he had ventured to come within its inclosure since I had been
left alone, without the sanction of his mother&rsquo;s or sister&rsquo;s
company, or at least the excuse of a message from them. But he managed to
appear so calm and easy, so respectful and self-possessed in his friendliness,
that, though a little surprised, I was neither alarmed nor offended at the
unusual liberty, and he walked with me under the ash-trees and by the
water-side, and talked, with considerable animation, good taste, and
intelligence, on many subjects, before I began to think about getting rid of
him. Then, after a pause, during which we both stood gazing on the calm, blue
water&mdash;I revolving in my mind the best means of politely dismissing my

distinct, to pour forth the most unequivocal expressions of earnest and
passionate love; pleading his cause with all the bold yet artful eloquence he
could summon to his aid. But I cut short his appeal, and repulsed him so

acquire&mdash;in a word, to &ldquo;make a man of him&rdquo; was one of their
staple amusements; and I need say no more to justify my alarm on his account,

instructors. I first attempted to keep him always with me, or in the nursery,
and gave Rachel particular injunctions never to let him come down to dessert as
long as these &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; stayed; but it was no use: these orders
were immediately countermanded and overruled by his father; he was not going to
have the little fellow moped to death between an old nurse and a cursed fool of
a mother. So the little fellow came down every evening in spite of his cross
mamma, and learned to tipple wine like papa, to swear like Mr. Hattersley, and
to have his own way like a man, and sent mamma to the devil when she tried to
prevent him. To see such things done with the roguish naÃ¯vetÃ© of that pretty
little child, and hear such things spoken by that small infantile voice, was as
peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll to them as it was inexpressibly
distressing and painful to me; and when he had set the table in a roar he would
look round delightedly upon them all, and add his shrill laugh to theirs. But

anything very extraordinary was said or done by the infant profligate, I
noticed, at times, a peculiar expression in his face that I could neither
interpret nor define: a slight twitching about the muscles of the mouth; a
sudden flash in the eye, as he darted a sudden glance at the child and then at
me: and then I could fancy there arose a gleam of hard, keen, sombre
satisfaction in his countenance at the look of impotent wrath and anguish he
was too certain to behold in mine. But on one occasion, when Arthur had been
behaving particularly ill, and Mr. Huntingdon and his guests had been
particularly provoking and insulting to me in their encouragement of him, and I
particularly anxious to get him out of the room, and on the very point of

injurious of the whole, his child&rsquo;s worst enemy, would still remain. I
could endure it for myself, but for my son it must be borne no longer: the

something worth while as a specimen of my powers, something to speak favourably
for me, whether as an actual painter or a teacher. Brilliant success, of
course, I did not look for, but some degree of security from positive failure
was indispensable: I must not take my son to starve. And then I must have money
for the journey, the passage, and some little to support us in our retreat in

And if, by any chance, he should look in here, I felt assured he would soon
depart on seeing me, for, instead of becoming less cool and distant towards me,
he had become decidedly more so since the departure of his mother and sisters,
which was just what I wished. Here, then, I set up my easel, and here I worked
at my canvas from daylight till dusk, with very little intermission, saving
when pure necessity, or my duties to little Arthur, called me away: for I still
thought proper to devote some portion of every day exclusively to his
instruction and amusement. But, contrary to my expectation, on the third

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XLI,"I had much trouble at first in breaking him of those evil habits his father had
taught him to acquire, but already that difficulty is nearly vanquished now:
bad language seldom defiles his mouth, and I have succeeded in giving him an
absolute disgust for all intoxicating liquors, which I hope not even his father
or his father&rsquo;s friends will be able to overcome. He was inordinately
fond of them for so young a creature, and, remembering my unfortunate father as
well as his, I dreaded the consequences of such a taste. But if I had stinted
him, in his usual quantity of wine, or forbidden him to taste it altogether,
that would only have increased his partiality for it, and made him regard it as
a greater treat than ever. I therefore gave him quite as much as his father was
accustomed to allow him; as much, indeed, as he desired to have&mdash;but into
every glass I surreptitiously introduced a small quantity of tartar-emetic,
just enough to produce inevitable nausea and depression without positive
sickness. Finding such disagreeable consequences invariably to result from this
indulgence, he soon grew weary of it, but the more he shrank from the daily
treat the more I pressed it upon him, till his reluctance was strengthened to
perfect abhorrence. When he was thoroughly disgusted with every kind of wine, I
allowed him, at his own request, to try brandy-and-water, and then
gin-and-water, for the little toper was familiar with them all, and I was
determined that all should be equally hateful to him. This I have now effected;
and since he declares that the taste, the smell, the sight of any one of them
is sufficient to make him sick, I have given up teasing him about them, except
now and then as objects of terror in cases of misbehaviour. &ldquo;Arthur, if
you&rsquo;re not a good boy I shall give you a glass of wine,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Now, Arthur, if you say that again you shall have some
brandy-and-water,&rdquo; is as good as any other threat; and once or twice,
when he was sick, I have obliged the poor child to swallow a little
wine-and-water <i>without</i> the tartar-emetic, by way of medicine; and this
practice I intend to continue for some time to come; not that I think it of any
real service in a physical sense, but because I am determined to enlist all the
powers of association in my service; I wish this aversion to be so deeply

have devised another scheme that might be resorted to in such a case; and if I
could but obtain my brother&rsquo;s consent and assistance, I should not doubt
of its success. The old hall where he and I were born, and where our mother
died, is not now inhabited, nor yet quite sunk into decay, as I believe. Now,
if I could persuade him to have one or two rooms made habitable, and to let
them to me as a stranger, I might live there, with my child, under an assumed
name, and still support myself by my favourite art. He should lend me the money
to begin with, and I would pay him back, and live in lowly independence and
strict seclusion, for the house stands in a lonely place, and the neighbourhood
is thinly inhabited, and he himself should negotiate the sale of my pictures
for me. I have arranged the whole plan in my head: and all I want is to

his never coming to see me when Mr. Huntingdon is at home. But he has never
openly expressed any disapprobation of him or sympathy for me; he has never
asked any questions, or said anything to invite my confidence. Had he done so,
I should probably have had but few concealments from him. Perhaps he feels hurt
at my reserve. He is a strange being; I wish we knew each other better. He used
to spend a month at Staningley every year, before I was married; but, since our

companions, abusing Mr. Grimsby and others, insinuating bitter things against
Mr. Huntingdon, and most ingeniously throwing the blame of her husband&rsquo;s
misconduct on to other men&rsquo;s shoulders. The latter was full of hope and
joy, yet with a trembling consciousness that this happiness would not last;
praising his goodness to the skies, but with an evident, though but
half-expressed wish, that it were based on a surer foundation than the natural

had a fine voice, and could sing like a nightingale, and accompany herself
sufficiently well on the piano; but these were her only accomplishments. There
was a look of guile and subtlety in her face, a sound of it in her voice. She
seemed afraid of me, and would start if I suddenly approached her. In her
behaviour she was respectful and complaisant, even to servility: she attempted
to flatter and fawn upon me at first, but I soon checked that. Her fondness for
her little pupil was overstrained, and I was obliged to remonstrate with her on
the subject of over-indulgence and injudicious praise; but she could not gain
his heart. Her piety consisted in an occasional heaving of sighs, and uplifting
of eyes to the ceiling, and the utterance of a few cant phrases. She told me
she was a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter, and had been left an orphan from her
childhood, but had had the good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious
family; and then she spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced
from its different members, that I reproached myself for my uncharitable
thoughts and unfriendly conduct, and relented for a time, but not for long: my

become of me. At last, however, I told her I was sensible of my error: I did
not complain of its punishment, and I was sorry to trouble my friends with its
consequences; but in duty to my son I must submit no longer; it was absolutely
necessary that he should be delivered from his father&rsquo;s corrupting
influence. I should not disclose my place of refuge even to her, in order that
she and my uncle might be able, with truth, to deny all knowledge concerning

they would not afflict themselves on my account, for if I could only reach my

fitted up as a kitchen. Here she procured us a light, roused the fire to a
cheerful blaze, and soon prepared a simple repast for our refreshment; while we
disencumbered ourselves of our travelling-gear, and took a hasty survey of our
new abode. Besides the kitchen, there were two bedrooms, a good-sized parlour,

sold most of my clothes for me, in a distant town, and procured me a wardrobe
more suitable to my present position: I have a second-hand piano, and a
tolerably well-stocked bookcase in my parlour; and my other room has assumed
quite a professional, business-like appearance already. I am working hard to
repay my brother for all his expenses on my account; not that there is the
slightest necessity for anything of the kind, but it pleases me to do so: I
shall have so much more pleasure in my labour, my earnings, my frugal fare, and
household economy, when I know that I am paying my way honestly, and that what
little I possess is legitimately all my own; and that no one suffers for my
folly&mdash;in a pecuniary way at least. I shall make him take the last penny I
owe him, if I can possibly effect it without offending him too deeply. I have a
few pictures already done, for I told Rachel to pack up all I had; and she
executed her commission but too well&mdash;for among the rest, she put up a
portrait of Mr. Huntingdon that I had painted in the first year of my marriage.

repulsive I should rather say&mdash;than he is now: for these six years have
wrought almost as great a change upon himself as on my feelings regarding him.

aside; not, I think, from any lurking tenderness for the memory of past
affection, nor yet to remind me of my former folly, but chiefly that I may

no doubt they would regret it; but would not all such sorrow be misplaced? And
if that illustration will not move you, here is another:&mdash;We are children
now; we feel as children, and we understand as children; and when we are told
that men and women do not play with toys, and that our companions will one day
weary of the trivial sports and occupations that interest them and us so deeply
now, we cannot help being saddened at the thoughts of such an alteration,

enlarged and elevated that we ourselves shall then regard as trifling those
objects and pursuits we now so fondly cherish, and that, though our companions
will no longer join us in those childish pastimes, they will drink with us at
other fountains of delight, and mingle their souls with ours in higher aims and
nobler occupations beyond our present comprehension, but not less deeply
relished or less truly good for that, while yet both we and they remain
essentially the same individuals as before. But, Gilbert, can you really derive
no consolation from the thought that we may meet together where there is no
more pain and sorrow, no more striving against sin, and struggling of the
spirit against the flesh; where both will behold the same glorious truths, and
drink exalted and supreme felicity from the same fountain of light and

it could not long remain a secret to the Millwards and Wilsons, and such was my
present appreciation of Eliza Millward&rsquo;s disposition, that, if once she
got a clue to the story, I should fear she would soon find means to enlighten
Mr. Huntingdon upon the place of his wife&rsquo;s retreat. I would therefore
wait patiently till these weary six months were over, and then, when the

beg to be allowed to clear her name from these vile calumnies: at present I

watching the passing changes in his fair, pale features, and observing the

deeply and fondly devoted to her, who can so thoroughly appreciate her
excellencies, and sympathise with all her thoughts, as I can do, and it would
be wrong in me to forget so excellent and divine a piece of God&rsquo;s
creation as she, when I have once so truly loved and known her.&rdquo; But I
said no more to him on that subject. I instantly started a new topic of
conversation, and soon took leave of my companion, with a feeling of less
cordiality towards him than usual. Perhaps I had no right to be annoyed at him,
but I was so nevertheless.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XLVI,"In little more than a week after this I met him returning from a visit to the
Wilsons&rsquo;; and I now resolved to do <i>him</i> a good turn, though at the
expense of his feelings, and perhaps at the risk of incurring that displeasure
which is so commonly the reward of those who give disagreeable information, or
tender their advice unasked. In this, believe me, I was actuated by no motives
of revenge for the occasional annoyances I had lately sustained from
him,&mdash;nor yet by any feeling of malevolent enmity towards Miss Wilson, but
purely by the fact that I could not endure that such a woman should be Mrs.
Huntingdon&rsquo;s sister, and that, as well for his own sake as for hers, I
could not bear to think of his being deceived into a union with one so unworthy
of him, and so utterly unfitted to be the partner of his quiet home, and the
companion of his life. He had had uncomfortable suspicions on that head
himself, I imagined; but such was his inexperience, and such were the
lady&rsquo;s powers of attraction, and her skill in bringing them to bear upon
his young imagination, that they had not disturbed him long; and I believe the
only effectual causes of the vacillating indecision that had preserved him
hitherto from making an actual declaration of love, was the consideration of
her connections, and especially of her mother, whom he could not abide. Had
they lived at a distance, he might have surmounted the objection, but within

observed and what he heard from others, and finally came to the conclusion

presence of Rachel. He begged I would not insist upon this: it was a useless
exposure of my want of faith in his word to the servant. I told him I was
sorry, but since he had forfeited my confidence, he must take the consequence.
He next pleaded inability to hold the pen. &ldquo;Then we must wait until you
can hold it,&rdquo; said I. Upon which he said he would try; but then he could
not see to write. I placed my finger where the signature was to be, and told
him he might write his name in the dark, if he only knew where to put it. But

illness and the strict regimen he is obliged to observe&mdash;so opposite to
all his previous habits. It is deplorable to see how completely his past life
has degenerated his once noble constitution, and vitiated the whole system of
his organization. But the doctor says he may now be considered out of danger,
if he will only continue to observe the necessary restrictions. Some
stimulating cordials he must have, but they should be judiciously diluted and
sparingly used; and I find it very difficult to keep him to this. At first, his
extreme dread of death rendered the task an easy one; but in proportion as he
feels his acute suffering abating, and sees the danger receding, the more
intractable he becomes. Now, also, his appetite for food is beginning to
return; and here, too, his long habits of self-indulgence are greatly against
him. I watch and restrain him as well as I can, and often get bitterly abused
for my rigid severity; and sometimes he contrives to elude my vigilance, and
sometimes acts in opposition to my will. But he is now so completely reconciled
to my attendance in general that he is never satisfied when I am not by his
side. I am obliged to be a little stiff with him sometimes, or he would make a
complete slave of me; and I know it would be unpardonable weakness to give up
all other interests for him. I have the servants to overlook, and my little
Arthur to attend to,&mdash;and my own health too, all of which would be
entirely neglected were I to satisfy his exorbitant demands. I do not generally
sit up at night, for I think the nurse who has made it her business is better

night&rsquo;s rest is what I but seldom enjoy, and never can venture to reckon

wants or his fancies require my presence. But he is manifestly afraid of my
displeasure; and if at one time he tries my patience by his unreasonable
exactions, and fretful complaints and reproaches, at another he depresses me by
his abject submission and deprecatory self-abasement when he fears he has gone
too far. But all this I can readily pardon; I know it is chiefly the result of
his enfeebled frame and disordered nerves. What annoys me the most, is his
occasional attempts at affectionate fondness that I can neither credit nor
return; not that I hate him: his sufferings and my own laborious care have
given him some claim to my regard&mdash;to my affection even, if he would only
be quiet and sincere, and content to let things remain as they are; but the

recapture Mr. Lawrence, or obtain any partner rich and elegant enough to suit
her ideas of what the husband of Jane Wilson ought to be, is yet in single
blessedness. Shortly after the death of her mother she withdrew the light of
her presence from Ryecote Farm, finding it impossible any longer to endure the
rough manners and unsophisticated habits of her honest brother Robert and his
worthy wife, or the idea of being identified with such vulgar people in the
eyes of the world, and took lodgings in &mdash;&mdash; the county town, where
she lived, and still lives, I suppose, in a kind of close-fisted, cold,
uncomfortable gentility, doing no good to others, and but little to herself;
spending her days in fancy-work and scandal; referring frequently to her
&ldquo;brother the vicar,&rdquo; and her &ldquo;sister, the vicar&rsquo;s
lady,&rdquo; but never to her brother the farmer and her sister the

Woodford were as unremitting as ever; though often less protracted than before.
We seldom <i>talked</i> about Mrs. Huntingdon; but yet we never met without
mentioning her, for I never sought his company but with the hope of hearing
something about her, and he never sought mine at all, because he saw me often
enough without. But I always began to talk of other things, and waited first to
see if <i>he</i> would introduce the subject. If he did not, I would casually
ask, &ldquo;Have you heard from your sister lately?&rdquo; If he said
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the matter was dropped: if he said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I would
venture to inquire, &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; but never &ldquo;How is her
husband?&rdquo; though I might be burning to know; because I had not the
hypocrisy to profess any anxiety for his recovery, and I had not the face to
express any desire for a contrary result. Had I any such desire?&mdash;I fear I
must plead guilty; but since you have heard my confession, you must hear my
justification as well&mdash;a few of the excuses, at least, wherewith I sought
to pacify my own accusing conscience.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XLIX,"In the first place, you see, his life did harm to others, and evidently no good
to himself; and though I wished it to terminate, I would not have hastened its
close if, by the lifting of a finger, I could have done so, or if a spirit had
whispered in my ear that a single effort of the will would be
enough,&mdash;unless, indeed, I had the power to exchange him for some other
victim of the grave, whose life might be of service to his race, and whose
death would be lamented by his friends. But was there any harm in wishing that,
among the many thousands whose souls would certainly be required of them before
the year was over, this wretched mortal might be one? I thought not; and
therefore I wished with all my heart that it might please heaven to remove him
to a better world, or if that might not be, still to take him out of this; for
if he were unfit to answer the summons now, after a warning sickness, and with
such an angel by his side, it seemed but too certain that he never would
be&mdash;that, on the contrary, returning health would bring returning lust and
villainy, and as he grew more certain of recovery, more accustomed to her
generous goodness, his feelings would become more callous, his heart more
flinty and impervious to her persuasive arguments&mdash;but God knew best.
Meantime, however, I could not but be anxious for the result of His decrees;

Helen might feel interested in her husband&rsquo;s welfare, however she might

At length a welcome &ldquo;yes&rdquo; drew from me the second question.
Lawrence divined my anxious thoughts, and appreciated my reserve. I feared, at
first, he was going to torture me by unsatisfactory replies, and either leave
me quite in the dark concerning what I wanted to know, or force me to drag the
information out of him, morsel by morsel, by direct inquiries. &ldquo;And serve
you right,&rdquo; you will say; but he was more merciful; and in a little while
he put his sister&rsquo;s letter into my hand. I silently read it, and restored
it to him without comment or remark. This mode of procedure suited him so well,
that thereafter he always pursued the plan of showing me her letters at once,
when &ldquo;inquired&rdquo; after her, if there were any to show&mdash;it was
so much less trouble than to tell me their contents; and I received such

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,XLIX,"The first of these communications brought intelligence of a serious relapse in
Mr. Huntingdon&rsquo;s illness, entirely the result of his own infatuation in
persisting in the indulgence of his appetite for stimulating drink. In vain had
she remonstrated, in vain she had mingled his wine with water: her arguments
and entreaties were a nuisance, her interference was an insult so intolerable
that, at length, on finding she had covertly diluted the pale port that was
brought him, he threw the bottle out of the window, swearing he would not be
cheated like a baby, ordered the butler, on pain of instant dismissal, to bring
a bottle of the strongest wine in the cellar, and affirming that he should have
been well long ago if he had been let to have his own way, but she wanted to
keep him weak in order that she might have him under her thumb&mdash;but, by
the Lord Harry, he would have no more humbug&mdash;seized a glass in one hand
and the bottle in the other, and never rested till he had drunk it dry.
Alarming symptoms were the immediate result of this &ldquo;imprudence,&rdquo;
as she mildly termed it&mdash;symptoms which had rather increased than
diminished since; and this was the cause of her delay in writing to her
brother. Every former feature of his malady had returned with augmented
virulence: the slight external wound, half healed, had broken out afresh;
internal inflammation had taken place, which might terminate fatally if not
soon removed. Of course, the wretched sufferer&rsquo;s temper was not improved
by this calamity&mdash;in fact, I suspect it was well nigh insupportable,
though his kind nurse did not complain; but she said she had been obliged at
last to give her son in charge to Esther Hargrave, as her presence was so
constantly required in the sick-room that she could not possibly attend to him
herself; and though the child had begged to be allowed to continue with her
there, and to help her to nurse his papa, and though she had no doubt he would
have been very good and quiet, she could not think of subjecting his young and
tender feelings to the sight of so much suffering, or of allowing him to
witness his father&rsquo;s impatience, or hear the dreadful language he was
wont to use in his paroxysms of pain or irritation.",0.0,0.0

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,L,"Had I forgotten my own prospects, my ardent love, my pertinacious hopes? It
seemed like sacrilege to revert to them now, but I had not forgotten them. It
was, however, with a gloomy sense of the darkness of those prospects, the
fallacy of those hopes, and the vanity of that affection, that I reflected on
those things as I remounted my horse and slowly journeyed homewards. Mrs.
Huntingdon was free now; it was no longer a crime to think of her&mdash;but did
she ever think of <i>me?</i> Not <i>now</i>&mdash;of course it was not to be
expected&mdash;but would she when this shock was over? In all the course of her
correspondence with her brother (our mutual friend, as she herself had called
him) she had never mentioned me but once&mdash;and that was from necessity.
This alone afforded strong presumption that I was already forgotten; yet this
was not the worst: it might have been her sense of duty that had kept her
silent: she might be only <i>trying</i> to forget; but in addition to this, I
had a gloomy conviction that the awful realities she had seen and felt, her
reconciliation with the man she had once loved, his dreadful sufferings and
death, must eventually efface from her mind all traces of her passing love for
me. She might recover from these horrors so far as to be restored to her former
health, her tranquillity, her cheerfulness even&mdash;but never to those
feelings which would appear to her, henceforth, as a fleeting fancy, a vain,
illusive dream; especially as there was no one to remind her of my
existence&mdash;no means of assuring her of my fervent constancy, now that we
were so far apart, and delicacy forbade me to see her or to write to her, for
months to come at least. And how could I engage her brother in my behalf? how
could I break that icy crust of shy reserve? Perhaps he would disapprove of my
attachment now as highly as before; perhaps he would think me too
poor&mdash;too lowly born, to match with his sister. Yes, there was another
barrier: doubtless there was a wide distinction between the rank and
circumstances of Mrs. Huntingdon, the lady of Grassdale Manor, and those of
Mrs. Graham, the artist, the tenant of Wildfell Hall. And it might be deemed
presumption in me to offer my hand to the former, by the world, by her friends,
if not by herself; a penalty I might brave, if I were certain she loved me; but
otherwise, how could I? And, finally, her deceased husband, with his usual
selfishness, might have so constructed his will as to place restrictions upon
her marrying again. So that you see I had reasons enough for despair if I chose
to indulge it.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,L,"Nevertheless, it was with no small degree of impatience that I looked forward
to Mr. Lawrence&rsquo;s return from Grassdale: impatience that increased in
proportion as his absence was prolonged. He stayed away some ten or twelve
days. All very right that he should remain to comfort and help his sister, but
he might have written to tell me how she was, or at least to tell me when to
expect his return; for he might have known I was suffering tortures of anxiety
for her, and uncertainty for my own future prospects. And when he did return,
all he told me about her was, that she had been greatly exhausted and worn by
her unremitting exertions in behalf of that man who had been the scourge of her
life, and had dragged her with him nearly to the portals of the grave, and was
still much shaken and depressed by his melancholy end and the circumstances
attendant upon it; but no word in reference to me; no intimation that my name
had ever passed her lips, or even been spoken in her presence. To be sure, I
asked no questions on the subject; I could not bring my mind to do so,
believing, as I did, that Lawrence was indeed averse to the idea of my union
with his sister.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,L,"I saw that he expected to be further questioned concerning his visit, and I saw
too, with the keen perception of awakened jealousy, or alarmed self-esteem, or
by whatever name I ought to call it, that he rather shrank from that impending
scrutiny, and was no less pleased than surprised to find it did not come. Of
course, I was burning with anger, but pride obliged me to suppress my feelings,
and preserve a smooth face, or at least a stoic calmness, throughout the
interview. It was well it did, for, reviewing the matter in my sober judgment,
I must say it would have been highly absurd and improper to have quarrelled
with him on such an occasion. I must confess, too, that I wronged him in my
heart: the truth was, he liked me very well, but he was fully aware that a
union between Mrs. Huntingdon and me would be what the world calls a
mÃ©salliance; and it was not in his nature to set the world at defiance;
especially in such a case as this, for its dread laugh, or ill opinion, would
be far more terrible to him directed against his sister than himself. Had he
believed that a union was necessary to the happiness of both, or of either, or
had he known how fervently I loved her, he would have acted differently; but
seeing me so calm and cool, he would not for the world disturb my philosophy;
and though refraining entirely from any active opposition to the match, he
would yet do nothing to bring it about, and would much rather take the part of
prudence, in aiding us to overcome our mutual predilections, than that of
feeling, to encourage them. &ldquo;And he was in the right of it,&rdquo; you
will say. Perhaps he was; at any rate, I had no business to feel so bitterly
against him as I did; but I could not then regard the matter in such a moderate
light; and, after a brief conversation upon indifferent topics, I went away,
suffering all the pangs of wounded pride and injured friendship, in addition to
those resulting from the fear that I was indeed forgotten, and the knowledge
that she I loved was alone and afflicted, suffering from injured health and
dejected spirits, and I was forbidden to console or assist her: forbidden even
to assure her of my sympathy, for the transmission of any such message through
Mr. Lawrence was now completely out of the question.",0.0,0.0

would think me cooled and changed for not returning it, or, perhaps, he had
already given her to understand that I had ceased to think of her. I would
wait, however, till the six months after our parting were fairly passed (which
would be about the close of February), and then I would send her a letter,
modestly reminding her of her former permission to write to her at the close of
that period, and hoping I might avail myself of it&mdash;at least to express my
heartfelt sorrow for her late afflictions, my just appreciation of her generous
conduct, and my hope that her health was now completely re-established, and
that she would, some time, be permitted to enjoy those blessings of a peaceful,
happy life, which had been denied her so long, but which none could more truly
be said to merit than herself&mdash;adding a few words of kind remembrance to
my little friend Arthur, with a hope that he had not forgotten me, and perhaps
a few more in reference to bygone times, to the delightful hours I had passed
in her society, and my unfading recollection of them, which was the salt and
solace of my life, and a hope that her recent troubles had not entirely

education, and with the management of her late husband&rsquo;s property, and
the regulation of his affairs. The rascal had never told me how that property
was disposed, or whether Mr. Huntingdon had died intestate or not; and I would
sooner die than ask him, lest he should misconstrue into covetousness my desire
to know. He never offered to show me his sister&rsquo;s letters now, and I

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,L,"Some time before Mr. Huntingdon&rsquo;s death Lady Lowborough eloped with
another gallant to the Continent, where, having lived a while in reckless
gaiety and dissipation, they quarrelled and parted. She went dashing on for a
season, but years came and money went: she sunk, at length, in difficulty and
debt, disgrace and misery; and died at last, as I have heard, in penury,
neglect, and utter wretchedness. But this might be only a report: she may be
living yet for anything I or any of her relatives or former acquaintances can
tell; for they have all lost sight of her long years ago, and would as
thoroughly forget her if they could. Her husband, however, upon this second
misdemeanour, immediately sought and obtained a divorce, and, not long after,
married again. It was well he did, for Lord Lowborough, morose and moody as he
seemed, was not the man for a bachelor&rsquo;s life. No public interests, no
ambitious projects, or active pursuits,&mdash;or ties of friendship even (if he
had had any friends), could compensate to him for the absence of domestic
comforts and endearments. He had a son and a nominal daughter, it is true, but
they too painfully reminded him of their mother, and the unfortunate little
Annabella was a source of perpetual bitterness to his soul. He had obliged
himself to treat her with paternal kindness: he had forced himself not to hate
her, and even, perhaps, to feel some degree of kindly regard for her, at last,
in return for her artless and unsuspecting attachment to himself; but the
bitterness of his self-condemnation for his inward feelings towards that
innocent being, his constant struggles to subdue the evil promptings of his
nature (for it was not a generous one), though partly guessed at by those who
knew him, could be known to God and his own heart alone;&mdash;so also was the
hardness of his conflicts with the temptation to return to the vice of his
youth, and seek oblivion for past calamities, and deadness to the present
misery of a blighted heart a joyless, friendless life, and a morbidly
disconsolate mind, by yielding again to that insidious foe to health, and

brilliant accomplishments; nor any other thing that I ever heard of, except
genuine good sense, unswerving integrity, active piety, warm-hearted

may readily imagine, combined to render her an excellent mother to the

self-depreciation, thought her a world too good for him, and while he wondered
at the kindness of Providence in conferring such a gift upon him, and even at
her taste in preferring him to other men, he did his best to reciprocate the
good she did him, and so far succeeded that she was, and I believe still is,
one of the happiest and fondest wives in England; and all who question the good

evening one would be already gone), and fly to Grassdale&mdash;I <i>must</i> be
there before the marriage. And why? Because a thought struck me that
<i>perhaps</i> I might prevent it&mdash;that if I did not, she and I might both
lament it to the latest moment of our lives. It struck me that someone might
have belied me to her: perhaps her brother; yes, no doubt her brother had
persuaded her that I was false and faithless, and taking advantage of her
natural indignation, and perhaps her desponding carelessness about her future
life, had urged her, artfully, cruelly, on to this other marriage, in order to
secure her from me. If this <i>was</i> the case, and if she should only
discover her mistake when too late to repair it&mdash;to what a life of misery
and vain regret might she be doomed as well as me; and what remorse for me to
think my foolish scruples had induced it all! Oh, I <i>must</i> see
her&mdash;she must know my truth even if I told it at the church door! I might
pass for a madman or an impertinent fool&mdash;even she might be offended at
such an interruption, or at least might tell me it was now too late. But if I
<i>could</i> save her, if she <i>might</i> be mine!&mdash;it was too rapturous
a thought!",0.0,0.0

snow heavily clogged the wheels and balled the horses&rsquo; feet; the animals
were consumedly lazy; the coachman most execrably cautious; the passengers
confoundedly apathetic in their supine indifference to the rate of our

that there was a wedding within. I ran in among them, demanding, with
breathless eagerness, had the ceremony long commenced? They only gaped and
stared. In my desperation, I pushed past them, and was about to enter the
churchyard gate, when a group of ragged urchins, that had been hanging like

contrast between her fate and his <i>must</i> darken his bliss for a time.
Perhaps, too, he thought of me: perhaps he regretted the part he had had in
preventing our union, by omitting to help us, if not by actually plotting
against us. I exonerated him from <i>that</i> charge now, and deeply lamented
my former ungenerous suspicions; but he <i>had</i> wronged us, still&mdash;I
hoped, I trusted that he had. He had not attempted to check the course of our
love by actually damming up the streams in their passage, but he had passively
watched the two currents wandering through life&rsquo;s arid wilderness,
declining to clear away the obstructions that divided them, and secretly hoping
that both would lose themselves in the sand before they could be joined in one.
And meantime he had been quietly proceeding with his own affairs; perhaps, his
heart and head had been so full of his fair lady that he had had but little
thought to spare for others. Doubtless he had made his first acquaintance with
her&mdash;his first intimate acquaintance at least&mdash;during his three
months&rsquo; sojourn at F&mdash;&mdash;, for I now recollected that he had
once casually let fall an intimation that his aunt and sister had a young
friend staying with them at the time, and this accounted for at least one-half
his silence about all transactions there. Now, too, I saw a reason for many
little things that had slightly puzzled me before; among the rest, for sundry
departures from Woodford, and absences more or less prolonged, for which he
never satisfactorily accounted, and concerning which he hated to be questioned
on his return. Well might the servant say his master was &ldquo;very

season&mdash;but, of course, I had little attention to spare for <i>them</i>.
It was not, however, for any tender colloquy that my companion had brought me
there:&mdash;",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"&ldquo;My aunt is particularly fond of flowers,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;and
she is fond of Staningley too: I brought you here to offer a petition in her
behalf, that this may be her home as long as she lives, and&mdash;if it be not
our home likewise&mdash;that I may often see her and be with her; for I fear
she will be sorry to lose me; and though she leads a retired and contemplative
life, she is apt to get low-spirited if left too much alone.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"&ldquo;By all means, dearest Helen!&mdash;do what you will with your own. I
should not dream of wishing your aunt to leave the place under any
circumstances; and we will live either here or elsewhere as you and she may
determine, and you shall see her as often as you like. I know she must be
pained to part with you, and I am willing to make any reparation in my power. I
love her for your sake, and her happiness shall be as dear to me as that of my
own mother.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"But it is time to bring my narrative to a close. Any one but you would say I
had made it too long already. But for <i>your</i> satisfaction I will add a few
words more; because I know you will have a fellow-feeling for the old lady, and
will wish to know the last of her history. I did come again in spring, and,
agreeably to Helen&rsquo;s injunctions, did my best to cultivate her
acquaintance. She received me very kindly, having been, doubtless, already
prepared to think highly of my character by her niece&rsquo;s too favourable
report. I turned my best side out, of course, and we got along marvellously
well together. When my ambitious intentions were made known to her, she took it
more sensibly than I had ventured to hope. Her only remark on the subject, in
my hearing, was&mdash;",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"&ldquo;And so, Mr. Markham, you are going to rob me of my niece, I understand.
Well! I hope God will prosper your union, and make my dear girl happy at last.
Could she have been contented to remain single, I own I should have been better
satisfied; but if she must marry again, I know of no one, now living and of a
suitable age, to whom I would more willingly resign her than yourself, or who
would be more likely to appreciate her worth and make, her truly happy, as far
as I can tell.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0

was not mistaken in her favourable judgment.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"&ldquo;I have, however, one request to offer,&rdquo; continued she. &ldquo;It
seems I am still to look on Staningley as my home: I wish you to make it yours
likewise, for Helen is attached to the place and to me&mdash;as I am to her.
There are painful associations connected with Grassdale, which she cannot
easily overcome; and I shall not molest you with my company or interference
here: I am a very quiet person, and shall keep my own apartments, and attend to
my own concerns, and only see you now and then.&rdquo;",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"Of course I most readily consented to this; and we lived in the greatest
harmony with our dear aunt until the day of her death, which melancholy event
took place a few years after&mdash;melancholy, not to herself (for it came
quietly upon her, and she was glad to reach her journey&rsquo;s end), but only
to the few loving friends and grateful dependents she left behind.",0.0,0.0
Wildfell Hall,Anne Bronte,LIII,"To return, however, to my own affairs: I was married in summer, on a glorious
August morning. It took the whole eight months, and all Helen&rsquo;s kindness
and goodness to boot, to overcome my mother&rsquo;s prejudices against my
bride-elect, and to reconcile her to the idea of my leaving Linden Grange and
living so far away. Yet she was gratified at her son&rsquo;s good fortune after
all, and proudly attributed it all to his own superior merits and endowments. I
bequeathed the farm to Fergus, with better hopes of its prosperity than I
should have had a year ago under similar circumstances; for he had lately
fallen in love with the Vicar of L&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s eldest
daughter&mdash;a lady whose superiority had roused his latent virtues, and
stimulated him to the most surprising exertions, not only to gain her affection
and esteem, and to obtain a fortune sufficient to aspire to her hand, but to
render himself worthy of her, in his own eyes, as well as in those of her
parents; and in the end he was successful, as you already know. As for myself,
I need not tell you how happily my Helen and I have lived together, and how
blessed we still are in each other&rsquo;s society, and in the promising young
scions that are growing up about us. We are just now looking forward to the
advent of you and Rose, for the time of your annual visit draws nigh, when you
must leave your dusty, smoky, noisy, toiling, striving city for a season of
invigorating relaxation and social retirement with us.",0.0,0.0
