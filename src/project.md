# Project Final Draft ☑️

See the Peer Review instructions for details about what to include in this final draft. Ideally, the same as your Check-in 5, plus revisions, plus a section in your "report" about what feedback you got and how you incorporated it.

Here, I just want to describe the grading.

Total, this project is worth 31 points:

- 10/31 came from Check-ins
- 6/31 came from Peer Review
- 15/31 comes from this for-real-final draft

Those 15 points for this final draft are broken down like this:

- 3 points for a clearly labeled and thoroughly written "notes on feedback" section in your write up
- 12 points for a high quality project that uses Python to analyze and visualize data, that includes a user-friendly text- or GUI-based interface, and to collect/scrape data as best suits your approach to your project, and a write up that thinks carefully about your approach and your results

I'll grade those 12 points using typical A/B/C percentages one might see on essays. So an "80% good" project only loses you a couple of points, 9.6/12. If you've gotten full points from completing all the other parts, that adds up to 28.6/31 for that project.

We've broken up the work throughout the semester and divvied the points up a *lot*. My hope was that, by doing this, we've given you the support you need to complete a good project *and* we've given you a safety net so that a few points off at the end won't hurt, but lackluster work throughout would.
