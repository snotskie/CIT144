# Peer Review Instructions ü§ù

Week 12 (as part of Check-in 5), submit your "like a final" draft to the Peer Review discussion board.

Week 13, give feedback to two people, for 6/100 total, or 3/100 each, towards your final grade.

Weeks 14 and 15 you will consider and implement feedback from your three reviewers (two student reviewers plus me). You will include a paragraph in your final draft that says how you did/didn't implement their feedback, for 4/100 towards your final grade.

Finally, Week 15 you will submit your for-real-final draft in the Week Fifteen folder. This is worth 11/100 towards your final grade for a website that makes efficient use of routes+templates, has valid HTML and CSS, is accessible, and clearly works towards the goals that you set out for yourself.

Therefore, the term project will come to a total of 31/100 towards your final grade (all the check-ins, plus the peer review, plus the note about addressing feedback, plus the final draft itself)

# Week 12

Post your term project to the Check-in 5 (Peer Review) discussion board as part of the check-in 5 instructions.

Attach your files / a link to your files that you made in Check-in 5 to your post.

In your discussion board post, give us a one-line intro to your project topic and ask any questions you want specific feedback on.

# Week 13

Wait until the start of Week 13 to do this, so that everyone's drafts can be ready:

Select two people to review. Select those with the least reviewers so far. Do not select someone with 2 student reviewers already. If possible, select one person whose topic you already know a good bit about.

Once you have chosen your people to review, leave a comment on their post saying, "I am reviewing you." Do this *first* so it makes clear to the other students who is already working on reviewing who.

Respond by the end of the week with a comment or Word/PDF document with your feedback. Be respectful, professional, and courteous. Try to point to specific examples in their write-up/data/code when giving feedback. Give feedback on the good, the bad, and areas for improvement for:

- What's good and should not change
- Did you get the code to work and did you get the same results as them
- Put into your own words how their data appears to have been collect, and whether that makes sense for their topic
- Put into your own words how their data was analyzed/counted up/etc. by their code, and whether that makes sense for their topic
- Put into your own words how their results were visualized, and whether that makes sense for their topic
- Put into your own words how they interpreted their results, whether that makes sense for their topic, and whether you are "convinced" by their claims
- Questions the project leaves you with
- Answers to the questions they had for you in their original discussion board post

# Weeks 14 and 15

Final drafts are due the Sunday of Week Fifteen (the week before final's), midnight Eastern time.

Make revisions to your files, then upload your your final draft, plus the following new section, to Blackboard:

- Notes on Feedback (what suggestions from me and your peers/friends/family did you take into consideration when editing your final draft, what changes did you make, and what suggestions did you not make and why?)
