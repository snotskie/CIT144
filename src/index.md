# CIT 144: Python I

Welcome in!

On this site I'll post lessons and assignments for our class. I do this because I share a lot of code examples, and they'll look a *lot* better this way than on BlackBoard. You'll still *submit* work through BlackBoard.

!!! tip

    If you use Google Chrome, [NaturalReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/naturalreader-ai-text-to/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk/) appears to be a decent option for reading our course content out loud. I write a lot for y'all to read. Sometimes having the voice there can help. (If the tool stops working, let me know. I last checked it July 13, 2023.)
