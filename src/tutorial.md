# Final Assignment

## Tutorial ðŸŽ­

Due at the end of Finals week, the following "tutorial" activity will fulfill the role of our Final Exam. This serves as a culminating activity and a final scaffold on our Studio, Lab, and Term Project assignments.

In it, you will make a video or script (your choice) teaching the audience one topic from our course (your choice).

This assignment is worth 12/100 towards your final grade.

For this, you have two options:

- Option 1. Submit a link to a youtube/etc. video that you have produced that is 7-10 minutes in length. Important: Include in the description of the video a statement that this is for our class, and also include your name in the description if your name is not already displayed on your youtube/etc. account somewhere.
- Option 2. Submit a 700-1000 word "script" for a video. Important: Include throughout the script screenshots showing "key frames" that you would be trying to hit were you to actually turn this script into a video.

If you are planning on doing the video option, try starting sooner rather than later in case you run into technical issues.

Regardless of which option you choose, you must:

- Teach your "audience" how to program something in Python
- Clearly and concisely explain all lines of code, imported libraries, functions, control structures, etc. that you use
- Include links to all tools used in the video description/at the top of the script
- Make the "starting point" clear from the beginning. For example, are we starting with an empty file, or are we starting with a template, or are we starting with code that you imagine we may have written during a previous tutorial?
- Make the "ending point" or "goal" of the tutorial clear from the beginning as well. Are we trying to write an entire video game, or are we just trying to get a communication loop with the user to work?
- Be sure to "wrap-up" in the last few seconds/words, possibly providing links to other videos/resources that the "audience" might be interested in if they want to learn more.
- And strive to pace the tutorial appropriately for your "audience." That is, try not to go too fast or too slow. You're also free to attempt humor/etc. to make your video/script more entertaining, just be careful not to get too off topic that you end up wasting the time of your "audience" who, I imagine, is in a hurry to learn how to code

I will be grading based on your clarity and demonstration of knowledge, not on the complexity of the program your video/script teaches your "audience" how to make. You are encouraged to use your Term Project as a starting point, demonstrating the process one might take to recreate one particular code example from your project that you are most proud of.
